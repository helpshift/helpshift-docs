<Intro>

Run Helpshift smoothly with Web apps/games using Webview or QR Code Integration.

</Intro>

Helpshift Support for Web provides multiple support experiences for your users. You can integrate our patented support experience link and QR code into your Web app/game in various ways.
Unlike a simple web URL, the “helpshift support experience link” dynamically creates a unique, secure and contextual web experience that provides these main benefits:

- It helps pass the necessary context [using CIFs, metadata]

- It authenticates users for the app/game

- It provides a universal support experience link and QR code that can be integrated into your PC app/game in multiple ways

The support experience link and QR code can be generated using the API mentioned below.

We have three support experiences:

1. **Web and Internal Webview Integration:** You can launch Helpshift Helpcenter within your Web app/game using internal webview integration, creating an in-game experience for the users. You need to add webview within Web app/game and link the **patented support experience link.**

     width="major"
     centered
   />{" "}

1. **Web and External Webview Integration:** You can launch Helpshift Helpcenter in a secondary window outside of the Web app/game using external webview integration. You need to add a secondary window redirect to the Web app/game and link the **patented support experience link.**

     width="major"
     centered
   />{" "}

1. **Web and QR Code Integration:** You can add generated QR Code to your Web app/game. Users can scan the QR code and open Helpshift’s contextual and authenticated support experience on their devices.

The support experience link and QR code can be generated using the API mentioned in [Helpshift APIs](../helpshift-apis) section.
