# Tracking {#tracking}

<Intro>

Attach metadata via Web Chat widget.

</Intro>

## Adding Tags to Conversations {#adding-tags}

You can attach tags while reporting an issue by passing them to the `helpshiftConfig` object at the time of initialization. You can pass an **array of strings** which will get added as Tags when the issue is created.

For example:

```javascript
// Make this change to the embed code placed before the closing </body> tag.

window.helpshiftConfig = {
  platformId: "<YOUR_APP_ID>",
  domain: "<YOUR_DOMAIN>",
  tags: ["foo", "bar"],
};
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

**On tag names & compatibility**

- Tags must be pre-created in the Helpshift Dashboard (Settings → Tags), otherwise they will be ignored.
- The attached tags must exactly match the tags present on the dashboard.

## Set Custom Issue Fields {#set-custom-issue-fields}

If you want to set Custom Issue Fields at the time of Issue creation, use the following API. This API will merge these fields with previously set fields.

```javascript
Helpshift("setCustomIssueFields", {
  // Key of the Custom Issue Field
  version: {
    // Type of Custom Issue Field
    type: "number",
    // Value to set for Custom Issue Field
    value: "10.0",
  },
  userInfo: {
    // Type of Custom Issue Field
    type: "singleline",
    // Value to set for Custom Issue Field
    value: "We have a new user!",
  },
});
```

The following are the valid values for the type property of a Custom Issue Field.

- singleline
- multiline
- number
- checkbox
- dropdown
- date

Compatibility table for type and values:

| Type       | Value   | Comments                                                        |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| singleline | string  | Character limit of 255                                          |
| multiline  | string  | Character limit of 100,000                                      |
| number     | string  |                                                                 |
| dropdown   | string  | Drop-down options should exist for the given Custom Issue Field |
| date       | number  | Epoch time. For example - **Date.now()**                        |
| checkbox   | boolean |                                                                 |

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

- This API should be called before the Issue is created (i.e. before the Webchat launcher is clicked or the [Open Widget API](/web-chat/api#open-widget) API is called). You won't be able to update Custom Issue Fields after the Issue is created.
- If any of the keys, types or values are invalid, that particular Custom Issue Field will get dropped.

</Admonition>

## Replace Custom Issue Fields {#replace-custom-issue-fields}

If you want to clear previous Custom Issue Fields and set new fields, use the following API.

```javascript
Helpshift("replaceCustomIssueFields", {
  // Key of the Custom Issue Field
  isMobile: {
    // Type of Custom Issue Field
    type: "checkbox",
    // Value to set for Custom Issue Field
    value: true,
  },
  browser: {
    // Type of Custom Issue Field
    type: "dropdown",
    // Value to set for Custom Issue Field
    value: "chrome",
  },
});
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

This API can be used when you want to navigate from one page to another and set different Custom Issue Fields for each page.

## Tracking user-specific metadata

With the new Identity System - [User Hub](/web-chat/identity-users), we have introduced new APIs
that allow you to track user-specific metadata via a simple Javascrip API. Please refer to the linked
section for details.
