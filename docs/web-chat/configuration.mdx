# Configuration

<Intro>

</Intro>

## Widget Configuration {#widget-config}

Helpshift allows you to configure the Web Chat widget by passing configuration options in the `helpshiftConfig` object.

### Widget Options {#widget-options}

To configure the widget's behavior, you'll need to add `widgetOptions` to the Embed Code. All of the widget specific options go here.

```javascript
(function () {
  // The following part remains as it is in the Embed Code.
  var PLATFORM_ID = "<YOUR_PLATFORM_ID>",
    DOMAIN = "<YOUR_DOMAIN>";

  window.helpshiftConfig = {
    platformId: PLATFORM_ID,
    domain: DOMAIN,
  };

  /* Widget Options Start */
  helpshiftConfig.widgetOptions = {
    // All widget specific options go here.
  };
  /* Widget Options End */
})();
```

#### Enable Fullscreen View for Pop-ups {#enable-full-screen}

If you want to open the widget in full screen mode on a non-mobile device, you can pass through the `fullScreen` option in `widgetOptions`.

```javascript
helpshiftConfig.widgetOptions = {
  // ...
  fullScreen: true,
};
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

On mobile devices and on low resolution tablets and desktops, the widget will open in full screen mode.

</Admonition>

#### Show/Hide Launcher {#show-launcher}

You can hide the default launcher and use your own launcher. You can control opening and closing of the conversation window using the `open` and `close` APIs. Add the following option in `widgetOptions` to hide the default launcher.

```javascript
helpshiftConfig.widgetOptions = {
  // ...
  showLauncher: false,
};
```

#### Widget Position {#widget-position}

To set the widget's position, provide the `position` option in `widgetOptions`. Values allowed for `position` are:

- bottom-right
- bottom-left
- top-left
- top-right

The default value is `bottom-right`.

```javascript
helpshiftConfig.widgetOptions = {
  // ...
  position: "bottom-left",
};
```

#### Widget z-index {#widget-z-index}

By default, Web Chat assigns a large `z-index` value to its widget (the launcher and conversation window). If you want to use a custom value of `z-index` for Web Chat, you can do so by setting the `zIndex` option in `widgetOptions`. You can only use a **number** with this option.

```javascript
helpshiftConfig.widgetOptions = {
  // ...
  zIndex: 50,
};
```

## Theming {#theming}

You can configure the Web Chat's greeting and color scheme directly from the Helpshift Dashboard. For more details, refer to [For Support Admins: Configure the User Experience](https://support.helpshift.com/kb/article/web-chat#section-three) in our Knowledge Base.

## Bots {#bots}

Bots can be enabled in Web Chat to automatically provide help and gather information from users to help your Agents resolve Issues faster. Helpshift has 3 default Bots:

- **QuickSearch Bot** - deflect common problems by automatically suggesting relevant FAQs to users
- **Identity Bot** - prompt your users for their name and/or email before they create an issue
- **CSAT Bot** - automatically ask for feedback after an Issue is resolved

For more details, refer to [Set Up Your Web Chat Bots](https://support.helpshift.com/kb/article/web-chat#section-four) in our Knowledge Base.

## Full Privacy {#full-privacy}

In the `helpshiftConfig` object at the time of initialization, setting the `fullPrivacy` option to `true` ensures [COPPA](http://www.coppa.org/) compliance by:

- Disabling user-initiated screenshots (users will not be able to attach files, including images, using Web Chat).
- Making sure that Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as name and email are not collected by Web Chat (using Identity Bot and/or the helpshiftConfig object). This means that if you set `userName` and `userEmail`, with `fullPrivacy` set to `true`, Helpshift will not use the `userName` and `userEmail` values.

Moreover, in scenarios where the user attaches objectionable content, it becomes a huge COPPA compliance concern. This option helps to solve this problem.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

If you are creating issues with the `fullPrivacy` option set to `true`, then donâ€™t use `New Issue Automation` (Refer [here](https://support.helpshift.com/kb/article/how-do-i-set-up-new-issue-automations/)) to auto-resolve them on the Agent dashboard. [Use `Time based Automation` (Refer [here](https://support.helpshift.com/kb/article/what-are-time-based-automations-and-how-do-i-set-them-up/)) instead]

##### Example Embed Code

```javascript
var PLATFORM_ID = "foo",
    DOMAIN = "bar";

window.helpshiftConfig = {
  platformId: PLATFORM_ID,
  domain: DOMAIN,
  // other options, if applicable
  fullPrivacy: true
};
```

## Initiating chat {#initiate-chat}

Developers can start a new chat when the previous issue is resolved, without needing any user action like clicking the `New Conversation` button or going through the post resolution flow like feedback bot for the previously resolved issue.

To do the above mentioned action, the developer will have to set `initiateChatOnLoad` config in `window.helpshiftConfig` and then use the [updateHelpshiftConfig](https://developers.helpshift.com/web-chat/api/#update-helpshift-config) API to start the new chat when the previous issue is resolved.

##### Example Embed Code

```javascript

window.helpshiftConfig.initiateChatOnLoad = true;

Helpshift("updateHelpshiftConfig");

```
To open the widget [open](https://developers.helpshift.com/web-chat/api/#open-widget) API can be used.
