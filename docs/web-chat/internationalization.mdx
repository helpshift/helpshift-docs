# Internationalization

<Intro>

</Intro>

Helpshift Web Chat currently supports 50 languages out-of-the-box (with English as the default).

## Supported languages {#supported-languages}

<SupportedLanguages />

## Setting a Language {#setting-a-language}

You can set the code of the language to be used by Web Chat in the `helpshiftConfig` object.

### Example Embed Code

```javascript
var PLATFORM_ID = "foo",
  DOMAIN = "bar";

window.helpshiftConfig = {
  platformId: PLATFORM_ID,
  domain: DOMAIN,
  // other options, if applicable
  // Set language to French ("fr")
  language: "fr",
};
// If you are setting language dynamically (i.e. after Web Chat has loaded),
// then refresh the widget:
Helpshift("updateHelpshiftConfig");
```

Alternatively, you can call the `setLanguage` API (Deprecated) to set the language after the initialization code.

```javascript
Helpshift("setLanguage", "fr");
```

<Admonition type="danger" title="Deprecation notice">

The preferred way to set the language is to use the `helpshiftConfig` object because the `setLanguage` API is deprecated.

Here's a screenshot of how Web Chat will look after setting the language to French.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

In order to ensure a smooth migration for existing users, the default language is set to English (`en`) i.e. if you don't set the `language` option in the `helpshiftConfig` object, Web Chat will use English as the language. You can set it to `browserDefault` in case you want your Web Chat widget experience to be in the browser's language.
