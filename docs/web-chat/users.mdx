## How to identify and manage users {#identify-and-manage-users}

### Logged in users {#logged-in-users}

#### Overview

A logged-in user uses Web Chat after providing your website with a username and password. If your website has logged-in users, we **highly recommend passing user identifiers (`userId` and/or `userEmail`)** with the `helpshiftConfig` object at the time of initialization. This helps your Agents provide a personalized support experience to your users, no matter which device or browser your end users are using. Passing the user identifiers to Web Chat also ensures ensures that a user's conversations are available only to them when they log in.

#### What to provide as user identifiers

You can set the `userId` and/or `userEmail` to identify your users. We highly recommend using a `userId` to identify your users. **If you use emails to identify your users, you must pass them with the `userEmail` field with the `helpshiftConfig` object**.

The following rules apply when you use both, userId and userEmail.

- When looking the user up in the Helpshift system, the priority of `userId` is higher than that of `userEmail`.
- When the `userId` matches that of an existing user, the existing user's email gets updated, if the email is provided.
- When the `userEmail` matches that of an existing user, the following rules apply:
  - If the `userId` doesn't exist for the user matched by the email, then the `userId` would be added to that user, if a `userId` is provided.
  - If the `userId` already exists for the user matched by the email, then a new user would be created, if a different `userId` is provided.

#### How to provide user's information

The helpshiftConfig object accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Important considerations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `userName`      | A user's name. Provide the name you'd like the Agents to use to address the user. If you don't have the user's name in your systems, you may leave it blank. The Identity Bot, if enabled, will ask the user for their name. If you provide a value for the name, then the Identity Bot will not ask the user for their name again.                                          | Max length â€“ 255 characters.

| `userId`        | A user's unique identifier. The userId values must be unique for your users, i.e. you should not use the same `userId` for different users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1. The max length is 750 characters. Values longer than this will result in the creation of an anonymous user.<br/>2. Leading/trailing spaces are not allowed. Spaces within the `userId` value are allowed, though. userId values with leading/trailing spaces will result in the creation of an anonymous user.<br/>3. The `userId` value is case-sensitive, e.g. "1abc" is different than "1ABC".<br/>4. Do not provide an email address as the `userId`. If you use email addresses to identify users, provide them with `userEmail`.<br />5. If you are using `userId` as well as `userEmail`, ensure that `userId` is present in all subsequent pages. Providing just the email may return another user's conversations, if multiple profiles have the same email. |
| `userEmail`     | A user's email address. If you don't know the user's email, you may leave it blank. The Identity Bot, if enabled, will ask the user for their email. If you provide a value for the email, then the Identity Bot will not ask the user for their email again.                                                                                                                | 1. The email should be in a valid format, e.g. "foobar@example.com". Invalid emails will result in the creation of an anonymous user.<br />2. Leading/trailing spaces are not allowed. Emails with leading/trailing spaces will result in the creation of an anonymous user.<br />3. The email value is case insensitive, e.g. "foobar@example.com" is same as "FOObar@Example.Com".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `userAuthToken` | A user authentication token is generated via Hash Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) using SHA256. You should provide a `userAuthToken` if you want to ensure that 3rd parties cannot file issues on behalf of your users or update their properties. You can find more details under the [Verifying the identity of users section](#verifying-the-identity-of-users). | A valid `userAuthToken` should be provided in order to ensure your users can file issues.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

- In order to create a logged-in user in Helpshift, the use of either `userId` or `userEmail` is required.
- All the parameter values should be of type string. Integer and decimal values are invalid.

##### Example Embed Code

```
var PLATFORM_ID = "foo",
    DOMAIN = "bar";

window.helpshiftConfig = {
  platformId: PLATFORM_ID,
  domain: DOMAIN,
  platformId: PLATFORM_ID,
  domain: DOMAIN,
  userId: "captain_planet",
  userEmail: "captain@example.com",
  userName: "Captain Planet",
  userAuthToken: "ab+dKOFgxspi3ARXSa/zSdN4wFrU6CQu3hJzHQtXYRI"
};
```

### Logging the users out {#logging-the-users-out}

Once a user logs out from your website, you should stop sending the user identifiers with the `helpshiftConfig` object to ensure that other users can't view this user's conversations. After you log a user out, only the conversations started by anonymous users using that specific browser will be visible.

### Anonymous Users {#anonymous-users}

#### Overview

An anonymous user is one who accesses Web Chat without providing your website with a username and password. If a user identifier is not passed with the `helpshiftConfig` object at the time on initialization, Helpshift assumes that the end user is an anonymous user, i.e. is not currently logged in. Similarly, if a user identifier is passed with the `helpshiftConfig` object, then the end user is assumed to be a logged-in user.

If your use-case involves multiple logged-in or anonymous users using the same device, ideally you wouldn't want the conversations to be shared across logins. In this case, you should use the `clearAnonymousUserOnLogin` option with the `helpshiftConfig` object at the time of initialization. If you set `clearAnonymousUserOnLogin` to `true`, then anonymous users will be cleared from Web Chat whenever a new user logs in. Once cleared, such users, and their conversations, are not fetched again.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

The anonymous user will be cleared from Web Chat after 7 days to make sure that the conversations by anonymous users do not persist on the browsers forever.

</Admonition>

##### Example Embed Code

```
var PLATFORM_ID = "foo",
    DOMAIN = "bar";

window.helpshiftConfig = {
  platformId: PLATFORM_ID,
  domain: DOMAIN,
  userId: "piano_man",
  clearAnonymousUserOnLogin: true
};
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

The `clearAnonymousUserOnLogin` functionality does not impact the logged-in user's experience at all.

## Verifying the identity of users {#verifying-the-identity-of-users}

### Configuring Identity Verification in your app {#configuring-identity-verification}

#### Overview

User Identity Verification is a security measure that verifies that all requests made from your Web Chat widget to Helpshift are coming from authentic end users. This prevents 3rd parties or hackers from impersonating your users. You can learn more about User Identity Verification and the steps to configure it [here](https://support.helpshift.com/kb/article/what-is-user-identity-verification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up).

In order to ensure your users are verified, you should provide a "user authentication token" with the `helpshiftConfig` object at the time of initialization. You can find the steps to generate a "user authentication token" [here](https://support.helpshift.com/kb/article/how-do-i-configure-the-endpoint-and-my-app-web-chat-widget-for-user-identity-verification/). The "user authentication token" is an HMAC Digest, which is generated via HMAC using SHA256.

#### Sending the user authentication token to verify users' identity

You can send the "user authentication token" along with the `userAuthToken` key of the `helpshiftConfig` object. If [Identity Verification is enabled on the Helpshift Dashboard](https://support.helpshift.com/kb/article/what-is-user-identity-verification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up/), Helpshift recalculates the unique user authentication token using the shared secret key, and compares the user authentication token sent by you to the recalculated value. If they're equal, the user's identity is verified, and the user is able to file Issues.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

- If the secret key is regenerated for an app on the Admin Dashboard, you should ensure you update your endpoint code as well in order to generate a valid "user authentication token". Following which, your Admins should delete the old secret key from the Dashboard in order to ensure requests using a "user authentication token" generated using the old secret key become invalid.
- If `fullPrivacy` is true, then the "user authentication token" should be generated only using the `userId`.

</Admonition>

##### Example Embed Code

```
var PLATFORM_ID = "foo",
    DOMAIN = "bar";

window.helpshiftConfig = {
  platformId: PLATFORM_ID,
  domain: DOMAIN,
  userId: "captain_planet",
  userEmail: "captain@example.com",
  userName: "Captain Planet",
  userAuthToken: "ab+dKOFgxspi3ARXSa/zSdN4wFrU6CQu3hJzHQtXYRI"
};
```

### Identity Verification failure {#identity-verification-failure}

#### Overview

When making a request to Helpshift with no `userAuthToken` or an invalid `userAuthToken`, Identity Verification will fail. If Identity Verification fails, the following will hold true.

- Anonymous users (users for whom you do not provide any identifiers) are always able to file issues.
- Logged-in users (users for whom you provide an identifier such as `userId` or `userEmail`) are not able to file issues or see conversations if they are unverified. Unverified logged-in users will have the following experience:
  - The Web Chat launcher icon will not be shown when the web page is loaded.
  - The Web Chat widget will show an error (if it's opened by means of the `open` API).
- If the logged-in users are verified (i.e. a valid `userAuthToken` is provided), they are able to see their previous conversations and create new Issues. The UI for verified logged-in users looks and works exactly the same as it would if Identity Verification were turned off. Only unverified users are impacted as described above.

### Testing & Troubleshooting {#testing-and-troubleshooting}
