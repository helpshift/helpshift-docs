# User Hub {#user-hub}

<Admonition type="info" title="note">

This feature is in closed beta. Contact Helpshift Customer Success to enable this feature.

</Admonition>

The new Identity System provides many advantages, with minimal efforts (as outlined below) over the legacy method, in the form of faster context collection,
easier agent experience, and enhanced security and spam protection.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure that the Identity System is enabled for your domain (reach out to Helpshift Customer Success if you wish to enable this)
2. Ensure that you have an endpoint set up for obtaining user JWTs on-demand

## Logging in your end-users {#login-user}

In order to use the new Identity system, you need to implement the following steps:
1. Specify the `authenticateWith` parameter in `helpshiftConfig` prior to loading Web Chat
2. Ensure that `userId` and/or `userEmail` are specified in `helpshiftConfig`
3. Start listening for the `onLoginRequest` event from Helpshift
4. Obtain a JWT for the given user from your dedicated endpoint
5. Log your user in with the JWT + full privacy information

```js
window.helpshiftConfig = {
  // ... your other config values
  // Step 1
  authenticateWith: "identities",

  // Step 2
  userEmail: "<your-user-email>",
  userId: "<your-user-id>"
}

/////////////////////////////////
// Your embed script goes here //
/////////////////////////////////

// Step 3: Add the event listener
Helpshift("addEventListener", "onLoginRequest", async ({userId, userEmail}) => {

    // Step 3:
    // Note: Your implementation here may vary. This is just an example.
    const identityToken = await fetch("<your-jwt-endpoint>", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "Accept": "application/json",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({userId, userEmail})
    })

    // Step 4:
    // Note: The userId/userEmail specified in the identity_token
    // MUST match the values specified in the helpshiftConfig object.
    // If they do not match, the login will be unsuccessful.
    Helpshift("login", {
      identity_token: identityToken,
      full_privacy_enabled: false // or true. Assumed false if not specified
    });
});
```

### Full privacy scenarios {#full-privacy-scenarios}

The following rules apply depending on the value of the `full_privacy_enabled` flag:
* If full privacy flag is false, one of `userId` or `userEmail` is mandatory, unless you are logging in an anonymous user.
* If `userId` is present and `full_privacy_enabled` is also true - Web Chat will use the `userId` to identify the user.
* If `userId` is absent and `full_privacy_enabled` is true - Web Chat will generate an anonymous ID and use this ID to identify the user.
* Full privacy is assumed to be false if no value is specified, or if the passed value is invalid.

### Best practices to follow for Login API {#login-best-practices}

* When you have more information to associate with current logged in user, use the `addUserIdentities` API.
* The `userId` or `userEmail` should uniquely identify the user across all users of your app. It should NOT be duplicated for two or more different users.
* If you are setting full_privacy_enabled to true, you shouldn't use email as the only identifier in the login API for that user. This will result in the creation of an anonymous user.
* For logging in a new user, first use the logout API, update the `userId` and `userEmail` in `helpshiftConfig`, and call `updateHelpshiftConfig`, to retrigger a new login request.

### Identity token format {#identity-token-format}

The identity token must be a **JWT signed using the shared secret** from your app settings in the dashboard.
When decoded, it must adhere to the following format:

```ts
interface Identity {
    identifier: "uid" | "email" | "phone_number" | "facebook_id" |
                "discord_id"|"whatsapp_id"|"google_playstore_id"|
                "apple_gamecenter_id" | "nintendo_id" | "psn_id" |
                "xbox_live_id" | "steam_id",
    value: string,
    metadata?: {
        [key:string]: string
    }
}

interface IdentityToken {
  identities: Identity[],
  iat: number // UNIX epoch time in seconds, generated in the last 24h or earlier
}
```

<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

Always generate the JWT on the server side, and store your shared secret securely.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">

Helpshift can also trigger the `onLoginRequest` event to reverify your user session  if we detect
suspicious activity or if the user's session is about to expire. In such cases, the same event handler
is sufficient for reverification, as long as you provide a JWT that has been generated within the last 24h.

We wait for the `onLoginRequest` callback to be executed for 5 seconds before we consider the session as expired.
If this happens, we replace the chat with a full screen session expired message.

</Admonition>

## With anonymous users {#with-anon-users}

We recommend logging in your end-user into Helpshift as early as possible, since it helps
streamline the entire support experience.

However, in the case where you have anonymous users, all you have to do is set the `authenticateWith` value,
and Helpshift will take care of generating an anonymous UID and logging your end-user in.

The `userId` and `userEmail` values can be omitted altogether or set to an empty string, `""`.

```js
window.helpshiftConfig = {
  // ... your other config values
  authenticateWith: "identities"
  // Notice that "userId" and "userEmail" are not specified here
}

/////////////////////////////////
// Your embed script goes here //
/////////////////////////////////
```

## Retroactively logging your end-user in {#retroactively-login-user}
In certain cases, your end-user may be anonymous for a short while before you log them in. In such cases, you will have to
update `helpshiftConfig` and call the `Helpshift("updateHelpshiftConfig")` API to trigger a new login.

```js
window.helpshiftConfig = {
  // ... your other config values
  authenticateWith: "identities"
  // Anonymous user since no userId/userEmail are provided
}

/////////////////////////////////
// Your embed script goes here //
/////////////////////////////////

// Register your event listener
Helpshift("addEventListener", "onLoginRequest", async ({userId, userEmail}) => {

    const identityToken = await fetch("<your-jwt-endpoint>", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "Accept": "application/json",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({userId, userEmail})
    })

    Helpshift("login", {
      identity_token: identityToken,
      full_privacy_enabled: false // or true. Assumed false if not specified
    });
});

// At some point in the future, when your user logs in:
window.helpshiftConfig.userId = "<your-user-id>"
window.helpshiftConfig.userEmail = "<your-user-email>"

Helpshift("updateHelpshiftConfig")
// ^ This will trigger the onLoginRequest event.
```

## Adding more user identities {#add-user-identities}

Note that although the API is named `identities`, if you wish to send multiple identities, they must be a part of the JWT's payload itself.
Essentially, the API expects a single string JWT and NOT an array of JWTs.

Example:
```js
  // ... Some custom logic here that obtains user data
  const identities = "header.payload.hash";
  Helpshift("addUserIdentities", identities)
```

Refer to [identity token format](#identity-token-format) for the schema of the identity
token.

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">

You can plug this API call into any place where you collect user identities. However, be careful not to call it in any
useEffect-like callbacks or frequently-firing events, since rate-limiting restrictions may kick in.

</Admonition>

For a list of errors that can occur when using this API, refer [ADD_USER_IDENTITY_FAILED](#add-user-identity-failed).

## Updating global user data {#update-global-user-data}

You can update your user's global data using this API.

The following key/value pairs are accepted in this API call:
```ts
interface CustomUserFields {
  [key: string]: string
}

interface GlobalUserData {
     // Note that all primitive values must be coerced to string
     first_name?: "string",
     last_name?: "string",
     full_name?: "string",
     display_name?: "string",
     last_country?: "string",
     last_city?: "string",
     age?: "string",
     lifetime_value?: "string",
     user_persona?: "string",
     user_vip_segment?: "string",
     user_support_status?: "string"
     last_active_date?: "string" // epoch time in ms/seconds
     accepted_t_and_c?: "string" // true/false converted to string
     preferred_language?:"string"

     // Non-primitives
     new_tags?: Array<string>
     tags_to_remove?: Array<string>
     reset_tags?: Array<string>
     custom_user_fields?: CustomUserFields
}
```

Example:
```js
  // ... Some custom logic here that obtains user data
  const full_name = "John Doe";

  Helpshift("updateGlobalUserData", {full_name})
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">

You can plug this API call into any place where you collect user data. However, be careful not to call it in any
useEffect-like callbacks or frequently-firing events, since rate-limiting restrictions may kick in.

Global user data is also referred to as **core attributes**.

</Admonition>

For a list of errors that can occur when using this API, refer [UPDATE_GLOBAL_USER_DATA_FAILED](#update-global-user-data-failed).

## Updating app user data {#update-app-user-data}

You can update your user's app or website-specific data using this API.

The following key/value pairs are accepted in this API call:
```ts
interface CustomUserFields {
  [key: string]: string
}

interface AppUserData {
     // Note that all primitive values must be coerced to string
      app_version: "string",
      user_vip_segment: "string",
      sdk_version: "string",
      language:"string",
      app_rating: "string",
      user_paying_segment: "string",
      country: "string"
      user_support_status: "string"
      user_persona: "boolean string"
      accepted_t_and_c: "string"
      user_level: "string",
      app_status: "string",
      city: "string",
      lifetime_value: "string",


      // Non-primitives
      custom_user_fields?: CustomUserFields
}
```

Example:
```js
  // ... Some custom logic here that obtains user data
  const app_rating = "5";

  Helpshift("updateAppUserData", {app_rating})
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">

You can plug this API call into any place where you collect user data. However, be careful not to call it in any
useEffect-like callbacks or frequently-firing events, since rate-limiting restrictions may kick in.

App user data is also referred to as **app attributes**.

</Admonition>

For a list of errors that can occur when using this API, refer [UPDATE_APP_USER_DATA_FAILED](#update-app-user-data-failed).

## Logging out your end-users {#logout-end-users}
To log out your end-users, you can use the logout API.


```js
Helpshift("logout");
```

Note that after calling this API, Web Chat will clear any user specific data from the `helpshiftConfig`
object, and reset the chat to an anonymous user. Depending on the value of `helpshiftConfig.clearAnonymousUserOnLogin`,
this can either be the previous anonymous user or a new anonymous user.

<Admonition type="info" title="Tip">

For a better user experience, consider hiding the chat widget after the user logs out.

</Admonition>

## Optimizations

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Web Chat will run smoothly even without these optimizations. However, if you want to see
faster load times for Web Chat, and reduced load on your infrastructure, you may choose to implement these
optimizations.

</Admonition>

### Send the identity_token in SSR requests {#send-identity-token-in-ssr}
If your application uses SSR, you can send the `identity_token` as part of your page load,
injecting it in the `onLoginRequest` callback directly.

_Please ensure that you do not set this value in a global variable to minimize the security risks for your
end-user._

<Admonition type="info" title="Caveat">

Helpshift fires the `onLoginRequest` event if we detect suspicious end-user activity. In such cases,
your page will provide a stale ID token, which will result in an expired support session.

A refresh of the page would allow their session to be restored.

This is usually not an issue for most end-users, but in case you want instant support session recovery, a JWT endpoint
would become necessary.

</Admonition>

### Caching the identity_token {#caching-id-token}
We highly discourage caching the `identity_token` on the client-side since it increases the potential
attack surface for XSS. However, you may choose to cache it on the server-side, provided that the cache
is invalidated before 24 hours elapse.

## Troubleshooting and tips {#troubleshooting-and-tips}

Login failure can be detected by listening to the [`onWebChatRuntimeError` event](/web-chat/api/#on-webchat-runtime-error).
The possible reasons for login failure are cited in the [`LOGIN_FAILED` runtime errors](#login-failed).

If your login is still failing, you can investigate these other potential reasons:
1. Ensure that your JWT endpoint is generating tokens in the accepted format
2. Ensure that your JWT endpoint is signing tokens with the shared secret
3. Ensure that your JWT endpoint has an `iat` (issued_at_time) value that is NOT older than 24h
4. In case you are caching the JWT, ensure that you do not cache it for longer than 24h.

## System limits

When using the User Identity APIs, the following system-level limits are applicable. Where applicable, these
limits will also be reported to you as documented in the [API failure reasons](#api-failure-reasons).

* Key lengths across all APIs - Max 255 chars
* Value length for any identity (except `uid`) - Max 300 chars
* Value length for `uid` identity - Max 750 chars
* Value length for CUF - Max 255 chars
* Value length for multiline CUF - Max 100000 chars
* Value length for user tags - Max 100 chars
* Collection size - Max 30 entries

## API failure reasons {#api-failure-reasons}

You can subscribe to the [onWebChatRuntimeError](/web-chat/api/#on-webchat-runtime-error) event
to handle these errors programmatically. The following errors are emitted for the User Identity APIs:
