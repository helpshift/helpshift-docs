# Getting Started <small>iOS</small> {#getting-started}

<Intro>

You're 3 steps away from adding great in-app support to your Unity game.

</Intro>

Guide to integrating the Unity plugin for the Helpshift SDK X which you can call from your C# and Javascript game scripts.

## Requirements {#version-requirements}

- Unity 2018.1.0 and above.
- Xcode 12.0 and above.
- iOS 13 and above.

## Download HelpshiftX Unity SDK for iOS {#getting-sdk}

<DownloadButton
  text="Download SDK"
  link="[% sdkx-unity.ios.sdk_url %]"
  classes="mb-4"/>

HelpshiftX SDK _.zip_ folder includes:

<div className="text-sm compact ">

|                                               |             |
| ----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| helpshiftX-plugin-unity-v10.3.1.unitypackage | Unity package of Helpshift SDK X         |
| unity-jar-resolver (v1.2.170.0)              | Resolves Android Helpshift package support lib dependencies. |

</div>

## Add Helpshift to your Unity project {#adding-to-project}

- Unzip the HelpshiftX Unity SDK package.
- HelpshiftX Unity SDK appears as a standard `.unitypackage` which you can import through the Unity package import procedure.
- Following are the steps to import the `helpshiftX-plugin-unity-version.unitypackage` into your Unity game:
  1. In the Open Unity project, navigate to **Assets** drop-down menu and select the **Import Package** > **Custom Package**
  2. From the unzipped SDK, select `helpshiftX-plugin-unity-version.unitypackage` file to import the Helpshift SDK.
  3. Click Import.

### Info.plist changes - Addition of usage description strings {#plist-description-strings}

When the “User Attachments” feature is enabled from the In-app SDK Configuration section, the SDK allows the user to upload attachments. The attachments are picked either from the Photo Library of File picker.

For photo library, Apple requires the app to have Photo Library Usage Description string in the Info.plist while. Failing to add these strings might result in app rejection. The following string is needed for the attachment feature:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Suggested string</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</td>
    <td>
      “We need to access photos library to allow users manually pick images
      meant to be sent as an attachment for help and support reasons.”
    </td>
    <td>
      This is not needed if your app is iOS 14 or above. Below iOS 14, this key
      is compulsory else the app may crash when user tries to open the photo
      library for attaching photos.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

The following instructions apply only to **versions below SDK X 10.2.0**.

#### Along with `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` (as mentioned above), also add `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` key in your application's Info.plist file.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Suggested string</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>NSCameraUsageDescription</td>
    <td>
      “We need to access the camera to allow users to click images meant to be
      sent as an attachment for help and support reasons.”
    </td>
    <td>
      This key is needed for capturing a photo using camera and attaching it.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</td>
    <td>
      “We need to access the microphone to allow users to record videos using
      camera meant to be sent as an attachment for help and support reasons.”
    </td>
    <td>
      This key is needed for capturing a video using camera and attaching it.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Initializing Helpshift in your app {#initializing}

### Helpshift's namespace {#namespace}

To use Helpshift's APIs, please import the Helpshift's namespace like below

```csharp
 using Helpshift;
```

1. First, create an app on the Helpshift Dashboard

   <Image src="/static/books/helpshiftx/add_app.png" width="full" />

2. Create an app with **iOS** as a selected `Platform`
   <Image src="/static/books/sdkx_ios/select_platform.png" width="full" />

Helpshift uniquely identifies each registered App with a combination of 2 tokens:

<div className=" compact">

|                          |                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <code>Domain Name</code> | This is your Helpshift domain name e.g. _happyapps.helpshift.com_ |
| <code>Platform ID</code> | Your App's unique App id                                          |

</div>

You can find these by navigating to `Settings > SDK (for Developers)` in your agent dashboard.
Select your App and _check IOS as a platform_ from the dropdowns and copy
the 2 tokens to be passed when initializing Helpshift.

<Image src="/static/books/sdkx_ios/copy_keys.png" width="full" />

Initialize Helpshift by calling the method _install(appId, domain)_ API

```csharp
using Helpshift;

public class MyGameControl : MonoBehaviour
{
    private HelpshiftSdk help;
    ...
    void Awake() {
        help = HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance();
        var configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>();
        help.Install(appId, domainName, configMap);
    }
    ...
}
```

#### Initializing Helpshift in your app for China {#chinasupport}

A special install config key, `isForChina`, should be used for integrating Helphift SDK for China region.
This config key accepts a boolean value. Pass `true` if you are integrating the SDK in an app for China region. The value defaults to `false` if left unspecified.

Initialize Helpshift by passing this key with appropriate value -

```csharp
using Helpshift;

public class MyGameControl : MonoBehaviour
{
    private HelpshiftSdk help;
    ...
    void Awake() {
        help = HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance();        
        var configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>()
            {
                { "isForChina", true },
            };
        help.Install(appId, domainName, configMap);
    }
    ...
}
```

## Start using Helpshift {#start-using}

Helpshift is now integrated in your app. You should now use the [support APIs](/sdkx-unity/support-tools-ios/) inside your app to experience the functionality provided by the Helpshift SDK.
