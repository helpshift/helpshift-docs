<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

All the public APIs in the SDK should be called after initializing the SDK via [HelpshiftSdk.install() API](/sdkx-unity/getting-started-ios#initializing)

</Admonition>

Helpshift SDK currently supports 50 languages out-of-the-box (with English as the default).

## Supported languages {#supported-languages}

<SupportedLanguages />

# Set SDK language {#language-change-programatically}

<SetLanguageDescription />

For example :

Setting SDK language for the given locale with only language code.

```csharp
using Helpshift

void Awake(){
	// Install call here
}

void setLanguage(){
	HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance().SetSDKLanguage("fr");
}
```

Here's a screenshot of how SDK will look after setting the language to French.

Setting the SDK language for the given locale with both language code and country code.

```csharp
HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance().SetSDKLanguage("zh-SG");
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

The default language is set to English (en) i.e. if you don't set any language using the `SetSDKLanguage` API, SDK will use English as language.
