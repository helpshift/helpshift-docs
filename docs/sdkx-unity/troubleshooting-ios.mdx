### Camera Permission for Attachment Flows {#camera-permission-for-attachments}

The attachment features of SDK X conversations opens the attachment menu. This is Safari's native menu with 3 options as of now, one of which is “Take Photo or Video”. This option requires your app to declare the camera permissions in the Xcode project's Info.plist file generated from Unity. If you don't declare it, and if the user selects this option, your app may crash. This option cannot be hidden as of now. We have it in our roadmap to add the ability to disable this option, though.

To avoid this crash, you need to add the following keys in your Xcode project's Info.plist file.

- NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription

- NSCameraUsageDescription

If your use-case allows you to not ask users to send attachments, you should disable the user attachments configuration on your app's App Settings page on the Admin Dashboard. This will hide the attachment icon altogether from the conversation, and you will not need to add the above-mentioned permissions to Info.plist file. Along with disabling the user attachments configuration, you should also not use the request attachment feature for the Agents.

Attachment features: These features let users send an attachment during a conversation — attachment icon in the reply box and request attachment message by agent.

### Unsupported Architectures Found While Submitting App to App Store {#unsupported-architectures-found}

Since Unity doesn't support `xcframework` packaging, we ship our SDK with `framework` packaging. This requires us to strip non-valid architectures (x86_64 and i386) while creating an archive. We achieve this by adding a Run Script phase named as `HS Strip Simulator Slices`. It executes `strip_frameworks.sh` script and removes non-valid architectures (x86_64 and i386) while creating an archive.

Now while submitting the app to App Store if you ran into an issue which states something like - "Unsupported Architectures. The executable for XYZ.app/Frameworks/HelpshiftX.framework contains unsupported architectures '[x86_64/i386]'". This probably means `strip_frameworks.sh` was not executed or didn't get executed as expected.

1. First make sure `strip_frameworks.sh` has executable permission. To find this script, go to directory where Xcode project is created from Unity. Under that directory you will find script under this path `Frameworks/Plugins/iOS/HelpshiftX.framework/`. You can give executable permission by running command `chmod +x strip_framework.sh`. Now, archive project and check again, if the issue persists then go to next step.

2. Replace the contents of `strip_frameworks.sh` with following -

# This script strips all non-valid architectures from dynamic libraries in
# the application's `Frameworks` directory.
#
# The following environment variables are required:
#
# BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR
# FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH
# EXPANDED_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY


# Signs a framework with the provided identity
code_sign() {
  # Use the current code_sign_identitiy
  echo "Code Signing $1 with Identity ${EXPANDED_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY_NAME}"
  echo "/usr/bin/codesign --force --sign ${EXPANDED_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY} --preserve-metadata=identifier,entitlements $1"
  /usr/bin/codesign --force --sign ${EXPANDED_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY} --preserve-metadata=identifier,entitlements "$1"
}

# Set working directory to product’s embedded frameworks
cd "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}"

if [ "$ACTION" = "install" ]; then
  echo "Copy .bcsymbolmap files to .xcarchive"
  find . -name '*.bcsymbolmap' -type f -exec mv {} "${CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR}" \;
else
  # Delete *.bcsymbolmap files from framework bundle unless archiving
  find . -name '*.bcsymbolmap' -type f -exec rm -rf "{}" +\;
fi

echo "Stripping frameworks"

declare -a INVALID_ARCHS=("x86_64" "i386")
echo "Invalid archs: ${INVALID_ARCHS[@]}"

for file in $(find . -type f); do
  # Skip non-dynamic libraries
  if ! [[ "$(file "$file")" == *"dynamically linked shared library"* ]]; then
    continue
  fi
  # Get architectures for current file
  archs="$(lipo -info "${file}" | rev | cut -d ':' -f1 | rev)"
  stripped=""
  for arch in $archs; do
    if [[ "(${INVALID_ARCHS[@]})" == *"$arch"* ]]; then
      # Strip non-valid architectures in-place
      lipo -remove "$arch" -output "$file" "$file" || exit 1
      stripped="$stripped $arch"
    fi
  done
  if [[ "$stripped" != "" ]]; then
    echo "Stripped $file of architectures:$stripped"
    if [ "${CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED}" == "YES" ]; then
      code_sign "${file}"
    fi
  fi
done
```

Now, archive project and check again. This should ideally resolve your issue. We will be updating our script in Helpshift unitypackage with the above changes soon.
