An easy way to setup push notifications is to uncomment relevant code in the `HsUnityAppController.mm` file. The class `HsUnityAppController` implements the `AppDelegateListener` and provides relevant delegate methods needed to get started with push notifications.

## Configure push notifications via Helpshift {#push-via-helpshift}

Notifications can be sent to your users when you reply to an issue submitted by them. In addition to the expected Push Notification behavior on iOS, you can customize your notifications to display a numbered badge on your App icon or play a sound alert when a notification is received.

If your app does not already use push, you will need to enable push for your app. To enable push notification in your application you need to add APNS registration code to your AppDelegate's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method:

```objc
- (BOOL) application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    ...
    UNUserNotificationCenter *center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];
    center.delegate = self;
    [center requestAuthorizationWithOptions:(UNAuthorizationOptionBadge     UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionAlert)
                                                                     completionHandler:^(BOOL granted, NSError *_Nullable error) {
                            ...
                        }];
    [UIApplication sharedApplication registerForRemoteNotifications];
    ...
}
```

<ConfigurePushNotificationsiOS />

### Configure the Helpshift iOS SDK to handle notifications {#configure-helpshift-sdk}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

When push is not configured, Helpshift SDK shows out-of-the-box "in-app notifications" for every message sent by Agents/Bots.
You should call `registerDeviceToken` API only after you have [configured the Helpshift dashboard](#configure-helpshift-push-admin) for push notifications. Calling the `registerDeviceToken` API without configuring the Helpshift dashboard will stop showing out-of-the-box "in-app notifications" for the end users.

</Admonition>

For Helpshift SDK to work with the Helpshift push notification service
you will need to invoke the `registerDeviceToken:` api call inside the application delegate method
`application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:`

In your app delegate file it will look something like this:

```objc
- (void) application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
    [Helpshift registerDeviceToken:deviceToken];
}
```

To respond to the delivery of notifications, you must implement a delegate for the shared UNUserNotificationCenter object. Your delegate object must conform to the UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate protocol, which the notification center uses to deliver notification information to your app:

1. If a notification arrives while your app is in the foreground, UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate's `willPresentNotification:` is called.
1. The system does not call the `userNotificationCenter:willPresentNotification:withCompletionHandler:` method when your app is in the background or is not running. In those cases, the system alerts the user according to the information in the notification itself.
   When the user selects an action from the notification interface, the system notifies your app of the user's choice. To receive responses, your delegate object must implement the `userNotificationCenter:didReceiveNotificationResponse:withCompletionHandler:` method.

In all of the above cases, you should check the "origin" field of the notification dictionary and call `handleNotificationWithUserInfoDictionary:isAppLaunch:` API if the origin of the notification is "helpshift". The Helpshift SDK will check Issues for which the notifications were received and will launch the Conversation screen for those Issues automatically. The isAppLaunch boolean flag here is used to distinguish between an active or backgrounded app vs. an app that was killed by the user. In the latter case, this flag should be set to true.

Example usage:

For the `userNotificationCenter:willPresentNotification:withCompletionHandler:` delegate -

```objc
- (void) userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center
  willPresentNotification:(UNNotification *)notification
  withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationPresentationOptions options))completionHandler {
  if([[notification.request.content.userInfo objectForKey:@"origin"] isEqualToString:@"helpshift"]) {
    [Helpshift handleNotificationWithUserInfoDictionary:notification.request.content.userInfo
                                                isAppLaunch:false];
    completionHandler(UNNotificationPresentationOptionNone);
  } else {
    // Handle foreground notifications other than Helpshift ones.
  }
}
```

For the `userNotificationCenter:didReceiveNotificationResponse:withCompletionHandler:` delegate -

```objc
- (void) userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center
 didReceiveNotificationResponse:(UNNotificationResponse *)response
          withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(void))completionHandler {
    if([response.notification.request.content.userInfo[@"origin"] isEqualToString:@"helpshift"]) {
        [Helpshift handleNotificationWithUserInfoDictionary:response.notification.request.content.userInfo
                                                isAppLaunch:YES];
    } else {
        // Handle push notifications other than Helpshift ones.
    }
    completionHandler();
}
```

### Badge count {#badge-count}

If you need to handle badge reset in the application icon, you can do something like below in the `applicationDidBecomeActive:` delegate method:

```objc
- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application
{
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setApplicationIconBadgeNumber:0];
}
```

To test Push Notifications for an app that is already in production please refer [this.](/ios/troubleshooting#test-push-production)

## In-app notifications {#in-app-notifications}

In-app notifications are similar to Apple's push notification banners. Unlike push notifications, they appear within your app when it is in use by the user.

These notifications are sent when an agent replies to a customer's issue. Your customers can click on these banners to go straight into the conversation screen.

## Configuring In-app notifications {#optional-flags}

The Helpshift [install call](/sdkx_ios/getting-started#initializing) supports flags for configuring SDK behaviour.
Currently we support one flag i.e `enableInAppNotification`.

### Enabling/Disabling In-app notifications {#enable-disable-in-app}

<div className="compact ">

|         |                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Flag    | enableInAppNotification              |
| Values  | <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> |
| Default | <code>true</code>                    |

</div>

If you do not want the in-app notifications support provided by the
Helpshift SDK, please set this flag to `false`. The default value of this
flag is `true` i.e in-app notifications will be enabled.<br />
Read more about in-app notifications in the [Notifications section.](/sdkx_ios/notifications#in-app-notifications)

Example:

```csharp
using Helpshift;

private HelpshiftSdk help;
this.help = HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance();
Dictionary<string, object> configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>();
configMap.Add(HelpshiftSdk.ENABLE_INAPP_NOTIFICATION, true);
help.Install(appId, domainName, configMap);
```

### Pausing In-app notifications {#pause-in-app}

If you have enabled in-app notifications, use the API `PauseDisplayOfInAppNotification()` to pause/resume the notifications. When `true` is passed to this method, display of in-app notifications is paused even if they arrive. When you pass `false`, the in-app notifications start displaying.

Example:

```csharp
using Helpshift;

// Install call
private HelpshiftSdk help;
this.help = HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance();
Dictionary<string, object> configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>();
configMap.Add(HelpshiftSdk.ENABLE_INAPP_NOTIFICATION, true);
help.Install(appId, domainName, configMap);

// To temporarily pause in-app notifications
help.PauseDisplayOfInAppNotification(true);

// To resume showing the in-app notifications
help.PauseDisplayOfInAppNotification(false);
```

## Showing notification count when replies are sent to the user {#showing-notification-count}

To fetch unread messages count from the server you can call `Helpshift.RequestUnreadMessageCount(shouldFetchFromServer)` API. This API will return unread messages count via delegate.
Based on the value of `shouldFetchFromServer`, the locally stored count will be returned if `shouldFetchFromServer` is `false` else from the server by fetching remotely when `shouldFetchFromServer` is `true`. An example use of this count is to update the badge count to indicate unread messsages. Please note that before calling this method, you need to set the listener for Helpshift events by calling the `Helpshift.SetHelpshiftEventsListener(eventsListener)` API.

```csharp
// Requesting unread count
private void RequestUnreadCount()
{
    Helpshift.RequestUnreadMessageCount(true);
}
```

When you call this API, you receive the unread count in your event listener which implements `IHelpshiftEventsListener`.
Following is an example implementation

```csharp
public class HSEventsListener : IHelpshiftEventsListener
{
    // ...
    public void HandleHelpshiftEvent(string eventName, Dictionary<string, object> eventData)
    {
      if(eventName.Equals(HelpshiftEvent.RECEIVED_UNREAD_MESSAGE_COUNT))
      {
        Debug.Log("Unread count: " + eventData[HelpshiftEvent.DATA_MESSAGE_COUNT]);
        Debug.Log("Is Unread count from cache: " + eventData[HelpshiftEvent.DATA_MESSAGE_COUNT_FROM_CACHE]);

        // Do something with the unread count here, for example, update the badge count.
      }
    }
    //...
}
```

- The notification count is fetched via this API from the SDK cache and Helpshift's servers (indicated by the value of `fromCache` in the example above). However, the count from Helpshift’s servers is rate limited and it returns the value only if a subsequent call is made to the API, after the reset timeout or when the user just closes the chat screen (whichever is earlier). For an active issue, the reset timeout is 1 minute and 5 minutes for inactive issues.
