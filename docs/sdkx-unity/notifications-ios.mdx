<Intro>

Configure Push and In-app notifications.

</Intro>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

All the public APIs in the SDK should be called after initializing the SDK via [HelpshiftSdk.install() API](/sdkx-unity/getting-started-ios#initializing)

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

An easy way to setup push notifications is to uncomment relevant code in the `HsUnityAppController.mm` file. The class `HsUnityAppController` implements the `AppDelegateListener` and provides relevant delegate methods needed to get started with push notifications.

</Admonition>

Notifications can be sent to your users when:

- You reply to an issue submitted by them
- You send a [Proactive Engagement](/sdkx-unity/proactive-engagement-ios) notification targeting the user

Setting push notifications involves configuring both the Helpshift admin dashboard as well as the client app.

## Configure push notifications in the Helpshift admin dashboard {##configure-helpshift-push-admin}

<ConfigurePushNotificationsiOS />

## Configure the Helpshift iOS SDK to handle notifications {#configure-helpshift-sdk}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

When push is not configured, Helpshift SDK shows out-of-the-box "in-app notifications" for every message sent by Agents/Bots.
You should call `registerDeviceToken` API only after you have [configured the Helpshift dashboard](#configure-helpshift-push-admin) for push notifications. Calling the `registerDeviceToken` API without configuring the Helpshift dashboard will stop showing out-of-the-box "in-app notifications" for the end users.

</Admonition>

### Request notification permission and register your app for push {#push-permission}

If your app does not already use push, you will need to enable push for your app. To enable push notification in your application you need to add APNS registration code to your AppDelegate's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method:

```objc
- (BOOL) application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    UNUserNotificationCenter *center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];
    center.delegate = self;
    [center requestAuthorizationWithOptions:(UNAuthorizationOptionBadge | UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionAlert)
                          completionHandler:^(BOOL granted, NSError *_Nullable error) {
        if(!granted) {
            NSLog(@"Notification auth denied");
        } else {
            NSLog(@"Notification auth granted");
            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                [UIApplication.sharedApplication registerForRemoteNotifications];
            });
        }
    }];
}
```

### Pass registered push token to Helpshift {#push-pass-to-helpshift}

For Helpshift SDK to work with the Helpshift push notification service
you will need to invoke the `registerDeviceToken:` api call inside the application delegate method
`application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:`

In your app delegate file it will look something like this:

```objc
- (void) application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
    [Helpshift registerDeviceToken:deviceToken];
}
```

### Implement push delegates {#push-delegates}

To respond to the delivery of notifications, you must implement a delegate for the shared UNUserNotificationCenter object. Your delegate object must conform to the UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate protocol, which the notification center uses to deliver notification information to your app:

- If a notification arrives while your app is in the foreground, UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate's `userNotificationCenter:willPresentNotification:withCompletionHandler:` is called.
- If a notification arrives while your app is in background or terminated, the system **does not** call the `userNotificationCenter:willPresentNotification:withCompletionHandler:` method. Instead, the system alerts the user according to the information in the notification itself.
- When the user selects an action from the notification interface, the system notifies your app of the user's choice. To receive responses, your delegate object must implement the `userNotificationCenter:didReceiveNotificationResponse:withCompletionHandler:` method.

In both cases, you should check the "origin" field of the notification dictionary and call the corresponding SDK APIs (mentioned below) if the origin is "helpshift". The Helpshift SDK will handle the notification transparently depending on it's payload:

Example usage:
- For notifications sent in response to agent replies on user's support conversations, the SDK will open the corresponding conversation.
- For proactive engagement notifications, the SDK will perform the dashboard configured action.

#### Push delegate when app is in foreground {#push-delegates-foreground}

For the `userNotificationCenter:willPresentNotification:withCompletionHandler:` delegate, invoke the `handleForegroundNotification:withCompletionHandler:` SDK API -


```objc
- (void) userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center
        willPresentNotification:(UNNotification *)notification
          withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationPresentationOptions)) completionHandler {
    NSDictionary *userInfo = notification.request.content.userInfo;
    if([@"helpshift" isEqualToString:userInfo[@"origin"]]) {
        [Helpshift handleForegroundNotification:userInfo withCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
    } else {
        completionHandler(UNNotificationPresentationOptionBanner |
                          UNNotificationPresentationOptionSound  |
                          UNNotificationPresentationOptionList);
    }
}
```

#### Push delegate when app is in background or not running {#push-delegates-background}

For the `userNotificationCenter:didReceiveNotificationResponse:withCompletionHandler` delegate, invoke the `handleBackgroundNotificationClick:withCompletionHandler:` SDK API -

```objc
- (void) userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center
 didReceiveNotificationResponse:(UNNotificationResponse *)response
          withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(void))completionHandler {
    NSDictionary *userInfo = response.notification.request.content.userInfo;
    if([@"helpshift" isEqualToString:userInfo[@"origin"]]) {
        [Helpshift handleBackgroundNotificationClick:userInfo withCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
    } else {
        completionHandler();
    }
    completionHandler();
}
```

### Configure NotificationService extension {#notification-service}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Your app only needs to configure the NotificationService extension if you are using Proactive Engagement feature. For support notifications, you can skip this configuration.

</Admonition>

If you are using Helpshift's [Proactive Engagement](/sdkx-unity/proactive-engagement-ios) feature, you will need to add a NotificationService extension to your app. This extension lets the app intercept the notification and modify it's payload before iOS system posts the notification in system tray. For more details on what this service extension does and how to configure it in your app, you can refer the [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/modifying-content-in-newly-delivered-notifications).

Helpshift uses this extension to download images to display in the push notification. If your app already has a NotificationService extension, you can re-use it for handling Helpshift notifications. In the `didReceiveNotificationRequest:withContentHandler:` method of your notification service, call the corresponding Helpshift API -

```objc
- (void) didReceiveNotificationRequest:(UNNotificationRequest *)request
                    withContentHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationContent *content))contentHandler {
    NSString *origin = request.content.userInfo[@"origin"];
    if([@"helpshift" isEqualToString:origin]) {
        [Helpshift handleBackgroundNotification:request
                             withContentHandler:contentHandler];
    } else {
        contentHandler(request.content);
    }
}
```

## In-app notifications {#in-app-notifications}

In-app notifications are similar to Apple's push notification banners. Unlike push notifications, they appear within your app when it is in use by the user.

These notifications are sent when an agent replies to a customer's issue. Your customers can click on these banners to go straight into the conversation screen.

## Configuring In-app notifications {#optional-flags}

The Helpshift [install call](/sdkx_ios/getting-started#initializing) supports flags for configuring SDK behaviour.
Currently we support one flag i.e `enableInAppNotification`.

### Enabling/Disabling In-app notifications {#enable-disable-in-app}

<div className="compact ">

|         |                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Flag    | enableInAppNotification              |
| Values  | <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> |
| Default | <code>true</code>                    |

</div>

If you do not want the in-app notifications support provided by the
Helpshift SDK, please set this flag to `false`. The default value of this
flag is `true` i.e in-app notifications will be enabled.<br />
Read more about in-app notifications in the [Notifications section.](/sdkx_ios/notifications#in-app-notifications)

Example:

```csharp
using Helpshift;

private HelpshiftSdk help;
this.help = HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance();
Dictionary<string, object> configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>();
configMap.Add(HelpshiftSdk.ENABLE_INAPP_NOTIFICATION, true);
help.Install(appId, domainName, configMap);
```

### Pausing In-app notifications {#pause-in-app}

Use the API `pauseDisplayOfInAppNotification` to pause/resume the notifications. When `YES` is passed to this method, display of in-app notifications is paused even if they arrive. When you pass `NO`, the in-app notifications start displaying. Note that if you have [disabled support in-app notifications](#enable-disable-in-app), this flag will have no effect for support notifications. It will still work for proactive engagement in-app notifications.

Example:

```csharp
using Helpshift;

// Install call
private HelpshiftSdk help;
this.help = HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance();
Dictionary<string, object> configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>();
configMap.Add(HelpshiftSdk.ENABLE_INAPP_NOTIFICATION, true);
help.Install(appId, domainName, configMap);

// To temporarily pause in-app notifications
help.PauseDisplayOfInAppNotification(true);

// To resume showing the in-app notifications
help.PauseDisplayOfInAppNotification(false);
```

## Notification badges {#notification-badges}

If you want to show your user notifications for replies you send to the
issues they posted, you can use notification counts provided by
Helpshift SDK that gives you the total number of unread messages and
display it as a badge. You can get notification counts asynchronously by
implementing the `IHelpshiftEventsListener` in your respective `.cs`
file. Notifications are typically displayed as badges
inside your app where a user invokes the help section. These badges can
be displayed anywhere in your app's interface to tell the user that they
have unread replies/messages from you. For example to display a badge on
a view (lets say its called yourView which can set its textLabel) while
you are polling for notifications using:

`Helpshift.RequestUnreadMessageCount(true)`

Please note that before calling this method, you need to set the listener for Helpshift events by calling the `Helpshift.SetHelpshiftEventsListener(eventsListener)` API.

You can implement something like the following in the notification count delegate method:

```csharp
public class HSEventsListener : IHelpshiftEventsListener
{
    // ...
    public void HandleHelpshiftEvent(string eventName, Dictionary<string, object> eventData)
    {
      if(eventName.Equals(HelpshiftEvent.RECEIVED_UNREAD_MESSAGE_COUNT))
      {
        Debug.Log("Unread count: " + eventData[HelpshiftEvent.DATA_MESSAGE_COUNT]);
        Debug.Log("Is Unread count from cache: " + eventData[HelpshiftEvent.DATA_MESSAGE_COUNT_FROM_CACHE]);

        // Do something with the unread count here, for example, update the badge count.
      }
    }
    //...
}
```

The notification count is fetched via this API from the SDK cache and Helpshift's servers (indicated by the value of `fromCache` in the example above). However, the count from Helpshift’s servers is rate limited and it returns the value only if a subsequent call is made to the API, after the reset timeout or when the user just closes the chat screen (whichever is earlier). For an active issue, the reset timeout is 1 minute and 5 minutes for inactive issues.

### Reset badge count {#reset-badge-count}
If you need to handle badge reset in the application icon, you can do
something like below in the `applicationDidBecomeActive:` delegate
method:
```objc
- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application
{
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setApplicationIconBadgeNumber:0];
}
```
