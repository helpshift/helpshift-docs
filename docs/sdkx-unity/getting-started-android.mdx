# Getting Started <small>Android</small> {#getting-started}

<Intro>

You're 3 steps away from adding great in-app support to your Unity game.

</Intro>

Guide to integrating the Unity plugin for the Helpshift SDK X which you can call from your C# and Javascript game scripts.

## Requirements {#version-requirements}

- Unity 5.5.6 and above.
- SDK X is functional only above API Level 24 i.e Android OS 7 Nougat and above.
- The `minSDKVersion` in code is kept as API Level 19 to allow importing the SDK and compiling in apps that allow installation till API Level 19 i.e Android 4.4 KitKat.
- If your app is installed on a device below API level 24 (i.e below Android OS 7 Nougat) then you can choose to have a different medium for providing support. For example, Email, Web etc.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

- From 10.4.0, SDK is compiled using Java 8 to ensure compatibility with Android 15 build tool chain.
- SDK 10.3.0 and above functions and is supported on Android 7 and above (API level 24 and above).
- You can still compile your app using a minimum API level of 19, but the support starts for API level 24 and above.
  For details regarding Helpshift SDK's Android OS support policy, please refer to [this article](https://support.helpshift.com/hc/en/13-helpshift-technical-support/faq/1217-sdk-x-os-technical-support-policy/).

## Add Helpshift to your Unity project {#adding-to-project}

- Unzip the Helpshift Unity SDK package.
- Helpshift Unity SDK appears as a standard `.unitypackage` which you can import through the Unity package import procedure.
- Following are the steps to import the `helpshiftx-plugin-unity-version.unitypackage` into your Unity game:
  1. In the Open Unity project, navigate to **Assets** drop-down menu and select the **Import Package** > **Custom Package**
  2. From the unzipped SDK, select `helpshiftx-plugin-unity-version.unitypackage` file to import the Helpshift SDK.
  3. In the _Import Unity Package window_, click **Import**
  4. If you are also integrating for iOS, select `iOS/Helpshift.framework` folder while importing the unitypackage. Refer [here](/sdkx-unity/getting-started-ios#adding-to-project).

## Resolve Android Appcompat library requirements {#resolve-android-appcompat-library-requirements}

Helpshift SDK depends on android appcompat libraries. You can get these libraries in one of the following ways depending on the build process that you use.

### Resolve dependency when using Unity's Internal or Unity's internal Gradle build system {#resolve-dependency-via-jar-resolver}

Use **Unity Jar Resolver** plugin to download and integrate android library dependencies.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

If your project already uses the _Unity Jar Resolver_, you can skip the _Unity Jar Resolver_ importing step.

You can use any version of _Unity Jar Resolver_ as per your needs. Helpshift packages this for convenience of developers.

You can find the _Unity Jar Resolver_ releases here: https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver/tags

</Admonition>

- Import the **Unity Jar Resolver** plugin into your Unity project

  1. In the Open Unity project, navigate to **Assets** drop-down menu and select the **Import Package** > **Custom Package**
  2. From the unzipped Helpshift SDK, select `unity-jar-resolver/external-dependency-manager-1.2.170.unitypackage` file to import the Unity Jar resolver.
  3. In the _Import Unity Package_ window, click **Import**

- If the Unity Jar resolver wants to enable Android Auto-resolution, click the _Enable_ button, to resolve all the dependencies automatically on changing any dependency file. You can enable or disable the settings using _Assets_ > _Play Services Resolver_ > _Android Resolver_ > _Settings_
- By default, the Unity jar resolver auto-resolves all the required dependencies. Following are the steps to resolve dependencies manually:
  1. In the Open Unity project, navigate to **Assets** dropdown menu and choose **Play services resolver** > **Android Resolve**
  2. Select the **Resolve** or **Force Resolve**
- To know more about the Unity Jar Resolver, refer to: [Unity Jar Resolver](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver)

### Resolve dependency when using custom Gradle template or Export Project {#resolve-dependency-via-gradle}

*Unity's in-built gradle build support* and *exporting to android studio* does not support per plugin gradle script. Therefore, by default, Helpshift SDK cannot add the dependencies by itself.

The `mainTemplate.gradle` is genereted when you enable the **Custom Gradle Template** property on the Player window.

The `build.gradle` exists in generated Gradle project when you enable the **Export Project** property on the Player window and Build the project.

Update **dependencies** section of the `mainTemplate.gradle` or `build.gradle` file as:

<Tabs groupId="android-dependencies-example">

<TabItem value=">= 10.3.0" label="10.3.X">

```groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
        implementation(name: 'Helpshift', ext:'aar')
        implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.0.0'
    }
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="<= 10.2.X>" label="Below 10.2.3">

```groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
        implementation(name: 'Helpshift', ext:'aar')
        implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0'
    }
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Please refer to Unity's Gradle template documentation here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/gradle-templates.html

## Initializing Helpshift in your app {#initializing}

To use Helpshift's APIs, please import the Helpshift's namespace like below

```csharp
using Helpshift;
```

1. First, create an app on the Helpshift Dashboard

   <Image src="/static/books/helpshiftx/add_app.png" width="full" />

2. Create an app with **Android** as a selected `Platform`

   <Image
     src="/static/books/helpshiftx/create_app_with_android_platform.png"
     width="full"
   />

Helpshift uniquely identifies each registered App with a combination of 2 tokens:

<div className=" compact">

|                          |                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| <code>Domain Name</code> | Your Helpshift domain. E.g. _happyapps.helpshift.com_ |
| <code>Platform ID</code> | Your App's unique App Id                              |

</div>
You can find these by navigating to `Settings`>`SDK (for Developers)` in your agent dashboard.
Select your App and _check Android as a platform_ from the dropdowns and copy
the 2 tokens to be passed when initializing Helpshift.
<Image src="/static/books/helpshiftx/copy_install_keys.png"  width="full" />

Initialize Helpshift by calling the method _install(appId, domain)_ API

```csharp
using Helpshift;

public class MyGameControl : MonoBehaviour
{
    private HelpshiftSdk help;
    ...
    void Awake() {
        help = HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance();
        var configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>();
        help.Install(appId, domainName, configMap);
    }
    ...
}
```

#### Initializing Helpshift in your app for China {#chinasupport}

A special install config key, `isForChina`, should be used for integrating Helphift SDK for China region.
This config key accepts a boolean value. Pass `true` if you are integrating the SDK in an app for China region. The value defaults to `false` if left unspecified.

```csharp
using Helpshift;

public class MyGameControl : MonoBehaviour
{
    private HelpshiftSdk help;
    ...
    void Awake() {
        help = HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance();
        var configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>();
        configMap.Add("isForChina", true);
        help.Install(appId, domainName, configMap);
    }
    ...
}
```

<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

** Placing the install call **

You should place install call inside the `Awake()` method. Placing it elsewhere might cause unexpected runtime problems.

**HelpshiftInitializationException**

Calling any API before the install call would throw an unchecked HelpshiftInitializationException in debug mode.

_Android OS version Support_

Calling `install()` below android SDK version 24 will not work. All the APIs will be non operable.

</Admonition>

## Start using Helpshift {#start-using}

Helpshift is now integrated in your app. You should now use the support APIs for [conversation screens](/sdkx-unity/support-tools-android#conversation-view) inside your app.

Run your app, and try starting a test conversation using the _ShowConversation_ API call.
Then goto your Helpshift agent dashboard and reply to experience the in-app messaging.

Sample usage for FAQs and conversation APIs:

```csharp
public class MyGameControl : MonoBehaviour
{
    private HelpshiftSdk help;

    void Awake(){
        // install call here
    }

    void OnGUI () {
        ...
        var configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>();
        // Starting a conversation with your customers
        if (MenuButton (contactButton))
        {
            help.ShowConversation(configMap);
        }
    }
}
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">
  Since the Helpshift plugin is meant for mobile devices only, you should put
  all Helpshift calls inside checks to make sure they are only called when
  running on a device.
