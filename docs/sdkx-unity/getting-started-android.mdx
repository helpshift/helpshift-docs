<Intro>

You're 3 steps away from adding great in-app support to your Unity game.

</Intro>

Guide to integrating the Unity plugin for the Helpshift SDK X which you can call from your C# and Javascript game scripts.

## Requirements {#version-requirements}

- Unity 5.5.6 and above.
- Supported Android OS version: 21 and above

## Download Helpshift Unity SDK {#getting-sdk}

#### 1. SDK X - In-app Customer Service {#standard-sdk}

<DownloadButton
  text="Download SDK"
  link="[% sdkx-unity.android.sdk_url %]"
  classes="mb-4"
/>

Helpshift SDK _.zip_ folder includes:

<div className="text-sm compact ">

</div>

## Add Helpshift to your Unity project {#adding-to-project}

- Unzip the Helpshift Unity SDK package.
- Helpshift Unity SDK appears as a standard `.unitypackage` which you can import through the Unity package import procedure.
- Following are the steps to import the `helpshiftx-plugin-unity-version.unitypackage` into your Unity game:
  1. In the Open Unity project, navigate to **Assets** drop-down menu and select the **Import Package** > **Custom Package**
  2. From the unzipped SDK, select `helpshiftx-plugin-unity-version.unitypackage` file to import the Helpshift SDK.
  3. In the _Import Unity Package window_, click **Import**
  4. If you are also integrating for iOS, select `iOS/Helpshift.framework` folder while importing the unitypackage. Refer [here](/sdkx-unity/getting-started-ios#adding-to-project).

## Resolve Android Appcompat library requirements {#resolve-android-appcompat-library-requirements}

Helpshift SDK depends on android appcompat libraries. You can get these libraries in one of the following ways depending on the build process that you use.

### Resolve dependency when using Unity's Internal or Unity's internal Gradle build system {#resolve-dependency-via-jar-resolver}

Use **Unity Jar Resolver** plugin to download and integrate android library dependencies.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

If your project already uses the _Unity Jar Resolver_, you can skip the _Unity Jar Resolver_ importing step.

You can use any version of _Unity Jar Resolver_ as per your needs. Helpshift packages this for convenience of developers.

You can find the _Unity Jar Resolver_ releases here: https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver/tags

</Admonition>

- Import the **Unity Jar Resolver** plugin into your Unity project

  1. In the Open Unity project, navigate to **Assets** drop-down menu and select the **Import Package** > **Custom Package**
  2. From the unzipped Helpshift SDK, select `unity-jar-resolver/external-dependency-manager-1.2.170.unitypackage` file to import the Unity Jar resolver.
  3. In the _Import Unity Package_ window, click **Import**

- If the Unity Jar resolver wants to enable Android Auto-resolution, click the _Enable_ button, to resolve all the dependencies automatically on changing any dependency file. You can enable or disable the settings using _Assets_ > _Play Services Resolver_ > _Android Resolver_ > _Settings_
- By default, the Unity jar resolver auto-resolves all the required dependencies. Following are the steps to resolve dependencies manually:
  1. In the Open Unity project, navigate to **Assets** dropdown menu and choose **Play services resolver** > **Android Resolve**
  2. Select the **Resolve** or **Force Resolve**
- To know more about the Unity Jar Resolver, refer to: [Unity Jar Resolver](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver)

### Resolve dependency when using custom Gradle template or Export Project {#resolve-dependency-via-gradle}

*Unity's in-built gradle build support* and *exporting to android studio* does not support per plugin gradle script. Therefore, by default, Helpshift SDK cannot add the dependencies by itself.

The `mainTemplate.gradle` is genereted when you enable the **Custom Gradle Template** property on the Player window.

The `build.gradle` exists in generated Gradle project when you enable the **Export Project** property on the Player window and Build the project.

Update **dependencies** section of the `mainTemplate.gradle` or `build.gradle` file as:

```
    dependencies {
        implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
        implementation(name: 'Helpshift', ext:'aar')
        implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0'
        //...
    }
```

Please refer to Unity's Gradle template documentation here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/gradle-templates.html

## Initializing Helpshift in your app {#initializing}

To use Helpshift's APIs, please import the Helpshift's namespace like below

```csharp

    using Helpshift;


```

1. First, create an app on the Helpshift Dashboard

   <Image src="/static/books/helpshiftx/add_app.png" width="full" />{" "}

2. Create an app with **Android** as a selected `Platform`
   <Image
     src="/static/books/helpshiftx/create_app_with_android_platform.png"
     width="full"
   />{" "}

Helpshift uniquely identifies each registered App with a combination of 2 tokens:

<div className=" compact">

|                          |                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| <code>Domain Name</code> | Your Helpshift domain. E.g. _happyapps.helpshift.com_ |
| <code>Platform ID</code> | Your App's unique App Id                              |

</div>
You can find these by navigating to `Settings`>`SDK (for Developers)` in your agent dashboard.
Select your App and _check Android as a platform_ from the dropdowns and copy
the 2 tokens to be passed when initializing Helpshift.
<Image src="/static/books/helpshiftx/copy_install_keys.png"  width="full" />

Initialize Helpshift by calling the method _install(appId, domain)_ API

```csharp

    using Helpshift;
    .
    .
    .
    public class MyGameControl : MonoBehaviour
    {
        private HelpshiftSdk help;
        ...

        void Awake() {
            help = HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance();
            var configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>();
            help.Install(appId, domainName, configMap);
        }
        ...
    }



```

<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

** Placing the install call **

You should place install call inside the `Awake()` method. Placing it elsewhere might cause unexpected runtime problems.

**HelpshiftInitializationException**

Calling any API before the install call would throw an unchecked HelpshiftInitializationException in debug mode.

_Android OS version Support_

Calling `install()` below android SDK version 21 will not work. All the APIs will be non operable.

</Admonition>

## Start using Helpshift {#start-using}

Helpshift is now integrated in your app. You should now use the support APIs for [conversation screens](/sdkx-unity/support-tools-android#conversation-view) inside your app.

Run your app, and try starting a test conversation using the _ShowConversation_ API call.
Then goto your Helpshift agent dashboard and reply to experience the in-app messaging.

Sample usage for FAQs and conversation APIs:

```csharp

    public class MyGameControl : MonoBehaviour
    {
        private HelpshiftSdk help;

        void Awake(){
            // install call here
        }

        void OnGUI () {
            ...
            var configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>();

            // Starting a conversation with your customers
            if (MenuButton (contactButton))
            {
                help.ShowConversation(configMap);
            }
        }
    }

```

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">
  Since the Helpshift plugin is meant for mobile devices only, you should put
  all Helpshift calls inside checks to make sure they are only called when
  running on a device.
