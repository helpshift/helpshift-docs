### Using AndroidX support libraries with 10.2.3 and below {#steps-to-build-with-android-x}

Helpshift Unity SDK X uses legacy Android support libraries.
If you want to use AndroidX libraries in your application please follow these steps to make Helpshift SDK compatible with AndroidX:

1. We recommend to use the standalone jetifier tool mentioned [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/jetifier).
2. To install Jetifier, [download the zip file](https://dl.google.com/dl/android/studio/jetifier-zips/1.0.0-beta07/jetifier-standalone.zip) and extract it. Your development environment must have **Java version 1.8** installed.
3. Use `standalone jetifier` tool to manually jetify the Helpshift library file:
   `<project>/Assets/Plugins/Android/Helpshift.aar`
4. Replace the existing `Helpshift.aar` files with the **file generated from the standalone jetifier tool**.

Example:

`./jetifier-standalone -i <input path>Helpshift.aar -o <output path>/Helpshift.aar`

#### Resolving AndroidX library dependencies:

##### Using External dependency manager

If you are using **`Unity Jar Resolver`** plugin to resolve support library requirements:

- Update the `<project>/Assets/Helpshift/Editor/HelpshiftDependencies.xml` to only use the AndroidX library and remove legacy Android support library:

- Your `HelpshiftDependencies.xml` file should look like - 

```xml
<androidPackages>
  <androidPackage spec="androidx.appcompat:appcompat:<version>"> </androidPackage>
</androidPackages>
```
##### Using Gradle

If you are using **`Gradle`** to resolve support library requirements:

- Update dependencies section of the `<project>/Assets/Plugins/Android/mainTemplate.gradle` or `build.gradle` file to use the AndroidX material library as:

```groovy
dependencies {
  ...
  implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:<version>'
  ...
}
```

After all these changes, **ensure there are no legacy Android support libraries present** in your project. Build your app and verify if all the UI screens are working as expected.

### Moved to AndroidX ( 10.3.0 and above versions )

Helpshift Unity SDK X has completely moved to AndroidX from `10.3.0`. If client app is using legacy libraries then SDK X will not compile.

## Sample Scene integration {#sample-scene-integration-issues}

If the `HelpshiftExampleScript.cs` script is not already attached to the `HelpshiftExample.unity` scene, then you need to manually attach it.

- Open the `Assets/Helpshift/Example/HelpshiftExample.unity` scene in Unity.
- Attach the `HelpshiftExampleScript.cs` script to this scene.
- Save the scene.
- Run on device and check.

## Known Issues {#known-issues}

### Multiple orientation changes might lead to inconsistent in-app behavior

With v10.5.0, Proactive Engagement's InApp notifications UI might get skewed when user changes the orientation of device multiple times when the notification is on the screen. This is due to inconsistent system callbacks on orientation change in Unity based applications.

### Compilation Errors Related to UI Components

Some projects using **Unity 6000.x** may fail to compile due to missing UI-related dependencies.

**Resolution**:
Install the **Unity UI** package.

Steps:
1. Open **Unity Package Manager**.
2. Search for **Unity UI**.
3. Install the package.
4. Rebuild the project.

Installing the Unity UI package resolves the compilation errors.

### Blank Screen in Helpshift Example Scenes

**Steps to resolve:**
1. Open the scene in Unity.  
2. Select the **Main Camera** (or any active Camera object).  
3. Save the scene (an asterisk will appear indicating changes).

After this, the scene should display correctly when run.
