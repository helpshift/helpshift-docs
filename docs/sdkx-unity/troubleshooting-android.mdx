# Troubleshooting {#troubleshoot}

## SDK integration {#integration-issues}

### Using AndroidX support libraries with 10.2.3 and below {#steps-to-build-with-android-x}

Helpshift Unity SDK X uses legacy Android support libraries.
If you want to use AndroidX libraries in your application please follow these steps to make Helpshift SDK compatible with AndroidX:

1. We recommend to use the standalone jetifier tool mentioned [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/jetifier).
2. To install Jetifier, [download the zip file](https://dl.google.com/dl/android/studio/jetifier-zips/1.0.0-beta07/jetifier-standalone.zip) and extract it. Your development environment must have **Java version 1.8** installed.
3. Use `standalone jetifier` tool to manually jetify the Helpshift library file:
   `<project>/Assets/Plugins/Android/Helpshift.aar`
4. Replace the existing `Helpshift.aar` files with the **file generated from the standalone jetifier tool**.

Example:

`./jetifier-standalone -i <input path>Helpshift.aar -o <output path>/Helpshift.aar`

#### Resolving AndroidX library dependencies:

##### Using External dependency manager

If you are using **`Unity Jar Resolver`** plugin to resolve support library requirements:

- Update the `<project>/Assets/Helpshift/Editor/HelpshiftDependencies.xml` to only use the AndroidX library and remove legacy Android support library:

- Your `HelpshiftDependencies.xml` file should look like - 

```xml
<androidPackages>
  <androidPackage spec="com.google.android.material:material:1.0.0"> </androidPackage>
</androidPackages>
```
##### Using Gradle

If you are using **`Gradle`** to resolve support library requirements:

- Update dependencies section of the `<project>/Assets/Plugins/Android/mainTemplate.gradle` or `build.gradle` file to use the AndroidX material library as:

```groovy
dependencies {
  ...
  implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.0.0'
  ...
}
```

After all these changes, **ensure there are no legacy Android support libraries present** in your project. Build your app and verify if all the UI screens are working as expected.

### Moved to AndroidX ( 10.3.0 and above versions )

Helpshift Unity SDK X has completely moved to AndroidX from `10.3.0`. If client app is using legacy libraries then SDK X will not compile.

## Sample Scene integration {#sample-scene-integration-issues}

If the `HelpshiftExampleScript.cs` script is not already attached to the `HelpshiftExample.unity` scene, then you need to manually attach it.

- Open the `Assets/Helpshift/Example/HelpshiftExample.unity` scene in Unity.
- Attach the `HelpshiftExampleScript.cs` script to this scene.
- Save the scene.
- Run on device and check.
