# Troubleshooting {#troubleshoot}

## SDK integration {#integration-issues}

### Using AndroidX support libraries {#steps-to-build-with-android-x}

Helpshift Unity SDK X uses legacy android support libraries.
If you want to use AndroidX libraries in your application please follow these steps to make Helpshift SDK compatible with AndroidX:

1. We recommend to use the standalone jetifier tool mentioned [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/jetifier).
1. To install Jetifier, [download the zip file](https://dl.google.com/dl/android/studio/jetifier-zips/1.0.0-beta07/jetifier-standalone.zip) and extract it. Your development environment must have Java version 1.8 installed.
1. Use `standalone jetifier` tool to manually jetify the Helpshift library files:
   `<project>/Assets/Plugins/Android/Helpshift.aar`
1. Replace the existing `Helpshift.aar` files with the files generated from the standalone jetifier tool.

Example:

`./jetifier-standalone -i <input path>Helpshift.aar -o <output path>/Helpshift.aar`

Resolving AndroidX library dependencies:

- When using `Unity Jar Resolver` plugin to resolve support library requirements:

Update the `<project>/Assets/Helpshift/Editor/HelpshiftDependencies.xml` to use the androidx libraries:

```
<androidPackages>
<androidPackage spec="com.google.android.material:material:1.0.0"> </androidPackage>
</androidPackages>
```

- When using `Gradle` to resolve support library requirements:

Update dependencies section of the `<project>/Assets/Plugins/Android/mainTemplate.gradle` or `build.gradle` file to use the androidx libraries as:

```
dependencies {
...
compile 'com.google.android.material:material:1.0.0'
...
}
```

After all these changes, run a clean build of your app and verify all the UI screens work as expected.

## Sample Scene integration {#sample-scene-integration-issues}

If the `HelpshiftExampleScript.cs` script is not already attached to the `HelpshiftExample.unity` scene, then you need to manually attach it.

- Open the `Assets/Helpshift/Example/HelpshiftExample.unity` scene in Unity.
- Attach the `HelpshiftExampleScript.cs` script to this scene.
- Save the scene.
- Run on device and check.
