# Deep Linking in FAQs {#android-deep-links}

<Intro>

Using custom URL schemes to support deep linking in your app

</Intro>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

All the public APIs in the SDK should be called after initializing the SDK via [HelpshiftSdk.Install() API](/sdkx-unity/getting-started-android/#initializing)

</Admonition>

Use custom URL schemes to direct users to particular link in your app
from Helpshift FAQs. You can use these schemes to provide a more
seamless experience for the user. For example, if your android app has a
registration screen, clicking on a registration link in an FAQ can
directly take the user to that screen.

## Deeplinking 

Deeplinks need to be handled in the Android Java code layer.

Please refer to [Deeplinking and code examples](/sdkx_android/deep-linking/) section for reference.
