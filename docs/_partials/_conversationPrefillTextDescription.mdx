Setting `conversationPrefillText` in the config allows you to set some text in the user's input box. This text will be inserted provided that:

- There is no ongoing (active) issue for the user.
- Text inputs are enabled for new conversations (e.g. the User Reply Input Type is not "Only Intent Menu").

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

The end-user can edit this text before sending it. There is a limit of 1,000 characters for this configuration value, so only the first 1,000 characters will be kept in the user input.

We recommend keeping your actual text even shorter for a better user experience, since the user has to read and edit it before sending it.

</Admonition>
