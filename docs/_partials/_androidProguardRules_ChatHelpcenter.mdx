If you are facing any issues related to loading or event updates from `Chat` or `Helpcenter` screens then there might be an issue with obfuscation of Helpshift SDK related code.
Make sure the following proguard rule is followed to skip obfuscation of the mentioned files:

```java
-keepclassmembers class com.helpshift.faq.HelpcenterToNativeBridge {
   public *;
}

-keepclassmembers class com.helpshift.chat.HSChatToNativeBridge {
   public *;
}
```
