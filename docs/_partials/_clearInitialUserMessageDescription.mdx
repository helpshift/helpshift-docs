If the end user starts a new conversation immediately in the same session,
then, by default, the initial user message is applied to all subsequent issues in the same session.
You can change this behaviour by setting the `initialUserMessage` key in `subsequentIssuesInSameSessionConfig`
to an appropriate value.

You can set the initial user message to an empty string, which will clear it and allow the
end-user to type a message for their subsequent issues. Alternatively, you can also supply a non-empty string
which will be used for all subsequent issues in the same session.

**We recommend setting this value to an empty string unless you want to run specific automation
flows for subsequent issues in the same session.**

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Currently, only the initial user message can be reset. Tags, Custom Issue Fields, and Conversation Prefill
Text values stay the same for subsequent issues in the same session.
