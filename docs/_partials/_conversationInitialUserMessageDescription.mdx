Initial user message configuration, `initialUserMessage`, helps you send the first message in a conversation on behalf of the user so that certain workflows are automatically triggered based on that message.

You should set this configuration before a conversation starts.
In other words, it works only when there is no active conversation for the user i.e. when a new user opens the chat screen for the first time
or existing user has already closed an ongoing conversation.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

If you set this configuration in the middle of an existing conversation it will not have any effect.
