# Upgrading to 3.0 and above {#sf-upgrade-to-30}

<Intro>

The Helpshift v3.0 is a major update and has important UI/UX changes. If you have questions or feedback, please <a href="https://support.helpshift.com/kb/contact/" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>

</Intro>

## Upgrading from 3.x to 3.x+1 {#upgrading-from-3x}

Skip 3.0 upgrade steps and navigate below to the new version heading.

## What is new in 3.0? {#what-is-new-in-30}

1. Optimized faster loading and syncing of messages.
2. Better UI/UX resembling a Helpshift’s agent experience.
3. Non-disruptive messages provide feedback on user actions.
4. Fewer DMLs and SOQLs.
5. Fewer API calls.
6. Better logging to enable troubleshooting.

## FAQs before the upgrade {#faqs-before-the-upgrade}

1. Will the upgrade affect our current flow? What if the new messenger doesn’t work? What if I find issues in the new admin panel/messenger?
   1. Your existing flows will not be impacted.
   2. There is no loss or change in data during the package upgrade.
   3. The old experience will be available too. If the new messenger or any admin functionality doesn’t work as per your expectations, or you do not like the new experience, you can switch back to the old experience. Please provide feedback to Helpshift Support on reasons to switch back.
2. What are the recommended pre-upgrade steps?
   1. Sandbox testing - Install the 3.0 package on your sandbox.
      1. Test with your usual workflows and use cases before installing/upgrading on the production org.
      2. Ensure the sandbox is not linked to the Helpshift production domain. If that happens, the link with the Salesforce production environment will break and all the new cases will start flowing into the Salesforce sandbox.
      3. Get in touch with Helpshift Support to create a test domain for linking with the sandbox.
   2. Contact Helpshift Support to try the Beta version of an upcoming package on the sandbox.
      1. Do not directly install on production using the link even if it works fine on the sandbox.
      2. Use an incognito window to install using the link.
   3. Do not add both, the old and the new, messenger components on the same page in production.
      1. It will slow down the case record page on production.
      2. We recommend testing on the sandbox first with both messengers added. That will help you to 1. compare the newer experience with the old messenger. 2. get used to the new experience.

## Upgrading the package {#upgrading-the-package}

1. Login to your Salesforce org which has the earlier package (eg. 2.19/2.11) installed.
2. Open a new browser tab and paste the package URL. (Package URL would be available on app exchange post-release.)
3. Once the page is loaded, a screen similar to the below would be seen
   <Image src="/static/books/salesforce/30-install-screen.png" width="full" />
4. The upgrade page would show the current version and the new version. In the above image, the current version is 2.19.
5. Choose “Install for Admins only“ and the package will be installed in approximately 5-10 minutes.

## After upgrading the package {#after-upgrading-the-package}

1. Things to check after upgrade \*\*\* IMP
   1. Verify whether the following picklist values are present in the Helpshift **Helpshift**Message_Type**c** field. This field can be found on the Helpshift Case Comment object from the object manager. [Add the new ones]
   ```text
   bot_control_message
   text
   faq
   action_card
   csat_rating
   csat_comment
   resolution_rsp
   confirmation_rejected
   confirmation_accepted

   {" "}
