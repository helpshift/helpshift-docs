# Integration

When in a game, we can import the package using Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package

<Image src="/static/books/pc-widget-unity/integrate-1.png" width="half" />

Import all the files from the package into the project

<Image src="/static/books/pc-widget-unity/integrate-2.png" width="half" />
This approach is the standard approach, where the game developers will have control over the widget's life cycle using the set of API's that are provided.
