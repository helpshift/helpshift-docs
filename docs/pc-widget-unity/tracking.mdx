Attach metadata via Helpshift PC Widget.

</Intro>

## Adding Tags to Conversations {#adding-tags}

You can attach tags while reporting an issue by passing them to the `HelpshiftConfig` object at the time of initialization. You can pass an **list of strings** which will get added as Tags when the issue is created.

For example:

```csharp
var tags = new List<string> { "premium", "support" };

var config = new HelpshiftConfig
{
    Domain = "<YOUR_DOMAIN>",
    PlatformId = "<YOUR_PLATFORM_ID>",
    AppId = "<YOUR_APP_ID>",

    Tags = tags,
};
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

**On tag names & compatibility**

- Tags must be pre-created in the Helpshift Dashboard (Settings â†’ Tags), otherwise they will be ignored.
- The attached tags must exactly match the tags present on the dashboard.

## Set Custom Issue Fields {#set-custom-issue-fields}

If you want to set Custom Issue Fields at the time of issue creation, you can pass them to the `HelpshiftConfig` object at the time of initialization.

```csharp
var joiningDate = new Dictionary<string, dynamic>();
joiningDate["type"] = "date";
joiningDate["value"] = 1505927361535;

var employeeName = new Dictionary<string, dynamic>();
employeeName["type"] = "singleline";
employeeName["value"] = "John Doe";

var cifs = new Dictionary<string, dynamic>();
cifs["joining_data"] = joiningDate;
cifs["employee_name"] = employeeName;

var config = new HelpshiftConfig
{
    Domain = "<YOUR_DOMAIN>",
    PlatformId = "<YOUR_PLATFORM_ID>",
    AppId = "<YOUR_APP_ID>",
    Cifs = cifs,
};
```

The following are the valid values for the type property of a Custom Issue Field.

- singleline
- multiline
- number
- checkbox
- dropdown
- date

Compatibility table for type and values:

| Type       | Value   | Comments                                                        |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| singleline | string  | Character limit of 255                                          |
| multiline  | string  | Character limit of 100,000                                      |
| number     | string  |                                                                 |
| dropdown   | string  | Drop-down options should exist for the given Custom Issue Field |
| date       | number  | Epoch time. For example - **Date.Now**                        |
| checkbox   | boolean |                                                                 |

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

- This config should be called before the issue is created (i.e. before the Helpshift PC Widget launcher is clicked or the [Show API](/pc-widget-unity/helpshift-apis/#show-pc-widget) is called). You won't be able to update Custom Issue Fields after the issue is created.
- If any of the keys, types or values are invalid, that particular Custom Issue Field will get dropped.
- If you want to update the Custom Issue Fields for subsequent issue creations, you need to update the cifs config in the HelpshiftConfig object and then use the [Update](/pc-widget-unity/helpshift-apis/#update-pc-widget-optional) API to update the Custom Issue Fields for subsequent issue creations.
