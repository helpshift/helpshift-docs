#### Importing the package into the unity project

1. In a game, we can import the package by navigating to **Assets→ Import Package → Custom Package**.

2. Import all the files from the package into the project.
<Image src="/static/books/pc-widget-unity/integrate-2.png" width="half" />

This standard approach allows game developers to control the Helpshift PC Widget's lifecycle using the provided set of [Helpshift PC Widget APIs](/pc-widget-unity/helpshift-apis/).
