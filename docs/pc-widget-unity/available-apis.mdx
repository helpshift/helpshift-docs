### Helpshift.Initialize
**Parameters:**
- path (string): The base path to the Application's streaming assets, e.g., Application.streamingAssetsPath.
- helpshiftConfig (object): A configuration object for the widget.
  
**Description:** Initializes the HelpShift widget and runs it in the background, enabling it to listen for notifications. If notifications are a high priority, this method should be called when the game starts to ensure timely event handling.
  
**Example Usage:**
```
Helpshift.Initialize(Application.streamingAssetsPath, helpshiftConfig);
```

### Helpshift.Show
**Parameters:** None

**Description:**

Displays the HelpShift widget on the screen.
- This is typically invoked during the on-click action of a clickable element (e.g., a button).
- `Important:` Ensure that HelpShift.Initialize() has been called earlier in the game flow before invoking this method; otherwise, the widget will not function properly.

**Example Usage:**
```
Helpshift.Show()
```

### HelpShift.Hide
**Parameters:** None

**Description:**

Hides the HelpShift widget from the screen.
- `Note:` Clicking the "X" button on the widget also triggers the hide functionality.
- `Usage:` Typically used in scenarios where the widget needs to be temporarily removed from view to avoid distractions, adapt to UI changes, or maintain a seamless user experience during specific gameplay moments, such as cutscenes, high-focus sequences, or state transitions.
- `Behaviour:` The widget is hidden instead of closed to ensure the background event system remains active for handling notifications.

**Example Usage:**
```
Helpshift.Hide()
```
### HelpShift.CleanUp
**Parameters:** None

**Description:**

Shuts down the Helpshift widget and terminates its background process. This method should be called during game shutdown to release resources and ensure proper cleanup.

- `Usage:` Call this inside Unity's `OnApplicationQuit()` method.

**Example Usage:**
```
Helpshift.CleanUp()
```

### HelpShift.Update ( Optional )
**Parameters:** None

**Description:**

Handles events sent from the HelpShift widget to Unity. This method is typically called inside Unity's Update() method.
- `Note:` This is optional in the current workflow as no events are being sent from the widget to Unity.

**Example Usage:**
```
Helpshift.Update()
```
