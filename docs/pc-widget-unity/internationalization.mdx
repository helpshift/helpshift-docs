## Setting a Language {#setting-a-language}

You can set the code of the language to be used by Helpshift PC Widget in the `HelpshiftConfig` object.

### Example Embed Code

```csharp
using HSWidgetLibrary

var config = new HelpshiftConfig
{
    Domain = "<YOUR_DOMAIN>",
    PlatformId = "<YOUR_PLATFORM_ID>",
    AppId = "<YOUR_APP_ID>",

    Language = "fr"
};

// Pass the configuration to the initialize API
Helpshift.Initialize(Application.streamingAssetsPath, config);
```

Here's a screenshot of how Helpshift PC Widget will look after setting the language to French.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

In order to ensure a smooth migration for existing users, the default language is set to English (`en`) i.e. if you don't set the `Language` option in the `HelpshiftConfig` object, Helpshift PC Widget will use English as the language.
