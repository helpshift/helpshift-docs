The repository contains 3 projects:
- ***HSUnityWidget*** which is a sample Unity Project.
- ***HSWidgetLibrary*** which is a .NET Framework dll project that runs in Unity and has the necessary APIs for integration.
- ***WPFWebview*** which is a .NET CORE WPF application that hosts the web view.

### WPFWebView

This is a .NET Core WPF application.

**Output:**
2 files (*Support.exe* and *WebView2Loader.dll*)

Publish the build and copy *Support.exe* and *WebView2Loader.dll* to the Unity sample project as below to the StreamingAssets folder.
Copying to StreamingAssets folder ensures that these binaries are copied to the final Unity player build.

If we are making any changes to this project, we should copy both the files to the StreamingAssets folders of the Sample Unity project
