    <tr>
        <td>Helpshift.Initialize</td>
        <td>
            Initializes the Helpshift widget and runs it in the background, enabling it to listen for notifications.<br/><br/>
            If notifications are a high priority, this method should be called when the game starts to ensure timely event handling.
        </td>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>path (string): The base path to the Application's streaming assets, e.g., Application.streamingAssetsPath.</li>
                <li>helpshiftConfig (object): A configuration object for the widget.</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td>
           <code>Helpshift.Initialize(Application.streamingAssetsPath, helpshiftConfig);</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Helpshift.Show</td>
        <td>
            Displays the Helpshift widget on the screen. This is typically invoked during the on-click action of a clickable element (e.g., a button).<br/><br/>
            Ensure that <code>Helpshift.Initialize()</code> has been called earlier in the game flow before invoking this method; otherwise, the widget will not function properly.
        </td>
        <td>None</td>
        <td>
            <code>Helpshift.Show()</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Helpshift.Hide</td>
        <td>
            Temporarily hides the Helpshift widget from the screen. This can also be triggered by clicking the "X" button on the widget.<br/><br/>
            Typically used when the widget should be hidden to minimize distractions, adjust to UI changes, or ensure a smooth user experience during focused gameplay moments, such as cutscenes, high-concentration sequences, or transitions between states. The widget is hidden rather than closed to keep the background event system active for handling notifications.
        </td>
        <td>None</td>
        <td>
            <code>Helpshift.Hide()</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Helpshift.CleanUp</td>
        <td>
            Destroy the Helpshift widget and terminates its background process. This method should be called during game shutdown to release resources and ensure proper cleanup.<br/><br/>
            Call this inside Unity's <code>OnApplicationQuit()</code> method.
        </td>
        <td>None</td>
        <td>
           <code>Helpshift.CleanUp()</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Helpshift.Update (Optional)</td>
        <td>
            Handles events sent from the Helpshift widget to Unity. This method is typically called inside Unity's <code>Update()</code> method.<br/><br/>
            This is optional in the current workflow as no events are being sent from the widget to Unity.
        </td>
        <td>None</td>
        <code>
            Helpshift.Update()
        </code>
    </tr>
