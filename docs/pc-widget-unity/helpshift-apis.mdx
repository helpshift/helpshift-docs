**Parameters:**

| Parameter        | Type   | Description                                                                              |

## Show PC Widget

#### Description  
Displays the Helpshift PC Widget on the screen. This is typically invoked during the on-click action of a clickable element (e.g., a button).

## Hide PC Widget

#### Description  
Temporarily hides the Helpshift PC Widget from the screen. This can also be triggered by clicking the "X" button on the Helpshift PC Widget. This method is typically used when the Helpshift PC Widget should be hidden to minimize distractions, adjust to UI changes, or ensure a smooth user experience during focused gameplay moments such as cutscenes, high-concentration sequences, or transitions between states. The Helpshift PC Widget remains active in the background to handle notifications.

**Parameters:**

None

**Example Usage:**

```csharp
Helpshift.Hide();
```

## Update PC Widget (Optional)
