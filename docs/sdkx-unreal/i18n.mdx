You can set the SDK language for the given locale using the method `SetLanguage("<language-code>")`

For example :

Here's a screenshot of how SDK will look after setting the language to French.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

The default language is set to English (en) i.e. if you don't set any language using the `SetLanguage` API, SDK will use English as language.
