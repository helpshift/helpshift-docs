## Privacy Info Manifest

Within the SDK, you'll discover a privacy manifest file located at helpshift-plugin-sdkx-unreal-v10.3.0/HelpshiftSDK/Source/ThirdParty/IOS/HelpshiftX_Static.embeddedframework/HelpshiftX_Static.framework/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy. To incorporate the necessary adjustments, developers can integrate the modifications from the SDK's privacy manifest file into their app's manifest.
