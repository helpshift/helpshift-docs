## Privacy Info Manifest

Within the SDK, you'll discover a privacy manifest file located at helpshift-plugin-sdkx-unreal-v10.3.0/HelpshiftSDK/Source/ThirdParty/IOS/HelpshiftX_Static.embeddedframework/HelpshiftX_Static.framework/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy. To incorporate the necessary adjustments, developers can integrate the modifications from the SDK's privacy manifest file into their app's manifest.

## Changing Unreal Engine Version {#changing-unreal-engine-version}

If the developer is using some different unreal engine version then they should modify the uplugin file and change the engine version there, too
