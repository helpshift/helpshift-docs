- The attachments key is only present if the agent has sent attachments.

  - HelpshiftEventDataMessageTypeAppReviewRequest
  - HelpshiftEventDataMessageTypeScreenshotRequest

The authentication failure reason is wrapped in an enum `EHelpshiftAuthenticationFailureReason` Example:

- `EHelpshiftAuthenticationFailureReason.REASON_AUTH_TOKEN_NOT_PROVIDED`
