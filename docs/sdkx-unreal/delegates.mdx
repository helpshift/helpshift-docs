- The key constants are available from SDK X 10.3.0 onwards. For older SDK X versions, please use the raw keys instead.
- The attachments key is only present if the agent has sent attachments.
- Since attachments sent by agents may not have the necessary MIME type or name, it is possible that `HelpshiftEvent.DATA_CONTENT_TYPE` is absent from the payload.
  For such cases, file type can be inferred from extension from file name
- HelpshiftEventDataMessageType has following types : 
  - HelpshiftEventDataMessageTypeAppReviewRequest
  - HelpshiftEventDataMessageTypeScreenshotRequest
  - HelpshiftEventDataMessageTypeText

You have to use `BindAuthFailureDelegate` to listen to Authentication failure events.

The authentication failure reason is wrapped in an enum `EHelpshiftAuthenticationFailureReason` Example:

Reason type :

- `EHelpshiftAuthenticationFailureReason.REASON_INVALID_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `EHelpshiftAuthenticationFailureReason.REASON_AUTH_TOKEN_NOT_PROVIDED`
- `EHelpshiftAuthenticationFailureReason.UNKNOWN`
