### User Authentication Failed Event {#user-authentication-failed-event}

If you have `user authentication feature` enabled on the Dashboard and if you pass an invalid token in the `Login(userDataMap)`, then you will receive this event with reason string. Check [here for more info](/sdkx-unreal/users)

You have to use `BindAuthFailureDelegate` to listen to Authentication failure events.

The authentication failure reason is wrapped in an enum `EHelpshiftAuthenticationFailureReason` Example:

Reason type :

- `EHelpshiftAuthenticationFailureReason.REASON_INVALID_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `EHelpshiftAuthenticationFailureReason.REASON_AUTH_TOKEN_NOT_PROVIDED`
- `EHelpshiftAuthenticationFailureReason.UNKNOWN`
