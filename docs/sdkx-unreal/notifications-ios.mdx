## Configure push notifications via Helpshift {#push-via-helpshift}

Notifications can be sent to your users when you reply to an issue submitted by them. In addition to the expected Push Notification behavior on iOS, you can customize your notifications to display a numbered badge on your App icon or play a sound alert when a notification is received.

If your app does not already use push, you will need to enable push for your app. To enable push notification in your application you need to add APNS registration code on app launch.

```objc
#if PLATFORM_IOS
UNUserNotificationCenter *center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];
    center.delegate = self;
    [center requestAuthorizationWithOptions:(UNAuthorizationOptionBadge | UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionAlert)
                                                                    completionHandler:^(BOOL granted, NSError *_Nullable error) {
        ...
    }];
    [UIApplication sharedApplication registerForRemoteNotifications];
    ...
#endif
```

### Configure Helpshift's push notification service in the Helpshift admin interface {#configure-helpshift-push-admin}

You can configure this in 4 simple steps:

Setup your application with Apple and enable Push notifications.

You need to generate certificates for APNS on Apple's portal that you can later provide to Helpshift. This lets Helpshift send push notifications to your users. Apple has moved away from old type of certificates to Apple Push Notification service SSL. There is another option to create Apple Push Notification Authentication Key, but Helpshift does not support this option yet. Its also possible that you still have the old type of certificate that has not yet expired, this is also supported by Helpshift.

Apple provides two variations of Apple Push Notification service SSL

- Apple Push Notification service SSL (Sandbox)
- Apple Push Notification service SSL (Sandbox & Production)

After creating your certificate, download it. Double click on it to import it to the Keychain Access Application. In the Keychain Access Application, right click on the certificate that was just added, and click export it in .p12 format. Please provide a password while exporting the certificate since we do not accept empty passwords. (Note that if your development private key is not present in Keychain Access, you will not be able to export it in .p12 format.)

To enable the Helpshift system to send push notifications to your users you will have to add iOS as a platform in your app (if you have not added already). And then click on the push notifications option.

  width="full"
  alt="Add-platform.png"
/>{" "}

After export, login and upload the .p12 file in your app in the Helpshift admin panel. Provide the same password you used while exporting to .p12 format.

Please note that you need to use the same bundle identifier in the app as the one you used to create the APNS certificate.

<Image
  src="/static/books/sdkx_ios/Add-certificate.png"
  width="full"
  alt="Add-certificate.png"
/>{" "}

You can configure whether to send a badge or not, and sound alerts if you provided custom sounds bundled with your app to handle notifications. Save it and you're all set.

#### Development (Sandbox) mode vs. Production mode

When you build and run your app from Xcode, it is in development (Sandbox) mode. To test push notifications from Helpshift in this mode make sure you choose 'Development Mode' while uploading either of the above two certificate types.

When you publish your app and download from App Store, your app is in Production mode. To test push notifications from Helpshift in production mode make sure you choose 'Production Mode' while uploading a certificate of 'Apple Push Notification service SSL (Sandbox & Production)' type. Sandbox mode certificate will not work on a production environment.

We do not support using the same certificate for both sandbox and production apps. In these cases we recommend you create two separate apps on our dashboard, one in 'Production mode' and the other in 'Development mode'. While testing please use the credentials of the developement mode app. When you are ready to publish, please replace the credentials with those of the production level app.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Your Push Certificate has an expiry date, as indicated in the below screenshot. Helpshift will not send you a reminder when your Push Certificate expires, so please make sure that your developer keeps a tab on the expiry date to reupload the Push Certificate.

### Configure the Helpshift Unreal SDK to handle notifications {#configure-helpshift-unreal-sdk}

After you have configured the push notifications in the Helpshift console, you will need to add additional setup in the project, too. First of all, you should enable the Use Push Notifications toggle in the Project Settings:

<Centered width="full">

![](/static/books/unreal/checkmark_push_notif.png)

</Centered>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

When push is not configured, Helpshift SDK shows out-of-the-box "in-app notifications" for every message sent by Agents/Bots.
You should call `registerDeviceToken` API only after you have [configured the Helpshift dashboard](#configure-helpshift-push-admin) for push notifications. Calling the `registerDeviceToken` API without configuring the Helpshift dashboard will stop showing out-of-the-box "in-app notifications" for the end users.

</Admonition>

For Helpshift SDK to work with the Helpshift push notification service
you will need to invoke the `registerDeviceToken:` api call inside the application delegate method
`application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:`

```objc
#if PLATFORM_IOS
#import <HelpshiftX_Static/HelpshiftX.h>
- (void) application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
    [Helpshift registerDeviceToken:deviceToken];
}
#endif
```

### Handling Push Notification {#handling-push-notification}

Add the below notification listeners on app launch. Preferably after Helpshift [Init](/sdkx-unreal/getting-started/#initializing)

```objc
#include "HelpshiftSDK.h"

#if PLATFORM_IOS
#import <HelpshiftX_Static/HelpshiftX.h>
#include "IOS/IOSAppDelegate.h"
#include "Misc/CoreDelegates.h"
#endif

#if PLATFORM_IOS
NSDictionary* ConvertFStringToNSDictionary(const FString& Json)
{
    // Convert FString to NSString
    NSString* JsonString = [NSString stringWithUTF8String:TCHAR_TO_UTF8(*Json)];

    // Convert NSString to NSData
    NSData* jsonData = [JsonString dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

    // Deserialize NSData to NSDictionary
    return [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:jsonData options:0 error:nil];
}


void HandleNotification(NSDictionary *payload,bool isAppLaunch) {

    // Check if the "origin" key exists in the dictionary
    if ([payload objectForKey:@"origin"] != nil) {
        NSString *originValue = [payload objectForKey:@"origin"];

        // Now you can use the originValue as needed
        if ([originValue isEqualToString:@"helpshift"]) {
            // Handle the case when origin is "helpshift"
            [Helpshift handleNotificationWithUserInfoDictionary:payload isAppLaunch:isAppLaunch];
        } else {
            // Handle other cases
        }
    } else {
        // app notifications
    }
}

UHelpshiftSettings* Settings = FHelpshiftSDKModule::Get().GetSettings();

if (!Settings->UsePushNotifications) {
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Error, TEXT("Use Push Notifications is not enabled in the Project Settings. Will not register the token."));
    return;
}
// Handle notification for foreground & background state
FCoreDelegates::ApplicationReceivedRemoteNotificationDelegate.AddStatic([](FString Json, int State) {
        
    NSDictionary* JsonDict = ConvertFStringToNSDictionary(Json);

    bool IsAppLaunch = (State == 3) ? false : true;

    if (JsonDict) {
        HandleNotification(JsonDict,IsAppLaunch);
    }
});

// Handle notification for killed state
NSDictionary *LocalLaunchOptions = [IOSAppDelegate GetDelegate].launchOptions;

if (LocalLaunchOptions) {
    NSDictionary *Payload = LocalLaunchOptions[@"UIApplicationLaunchOptionsRemoteNotificationKey"];
    HandleNotification(Payload,true);
}

#endif
```

## In-app notifications {#in-app-notifications}

In-app notifications, unlike push notifications, appear within your app when it is in use by the user.

These notifications are sent when an agent replies to a customer's issue. Your customers can click on these banners to go straight into the conversation screen.

  alt="In-app-notification.png"
/>{" "}

</SideBySide>

### Configuring In-app notifications {#optional-flags}

The Helpshift [Init](/sdkx-unreal/getting-started/) call supports flags for configuring SDK behaviour.
Currently we support one flag i.e `HelpshiftConfigEnableInAppNotificationsKey`.

### Enabling/Disabling In-app notifications {#enable-disable-in-app}

<div className="compact ">

|         |                                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Flag    | HelpshiftConfigEnableInAppNotificationsKey |
| Values  | true / false                               |
| Default | true                                       |

</div>

If you do not want the in-app notifications support provided by the
Helpshift SDK, please set this flag to `false`. The default value of this
flag is `true` i.e in-app notifications will be enabled.<br />

## Showing notification count when replies are sent to the user {#showing-notification-count}

To fetch unread messages count from the server you can call `RequestUnreadMessageCount(bool FetchFromServer);` API. This API will return unread messages count via delegate. Based on the value of `FetchFromServer`, the locally stored count will be returned if `FetchFromServer` is `false` else from the server by fetching remotely when `FetchFromServer` is `true`. An example use of this count is to update the badge count to indicate unread messsages. Please note that before calling this method, you need to set the listener for Helpshift events by calling the `BindEventDelegate(const FHelpshiftEventDelegate& Callback)` API.

<Centered width="full">

![](/static/books/unreal/unread_count.png)

</Centered>

When you call this API, you receive the unread count in your event delegate `HelpshiftEventReceivedUnreadMessageCount()`
Keys in event data: `HelpshiftEventDataMessageCount (int)`, `HelpshiftEventDataMessageCountFromCache (int)`

- The notification count is fetched via this API from the SDK cache and Helpshift's servers (indicated by the value of `HelpshiftEventDataMessageCountFromCache (int)` in the example above). However, the count from Helpshift’s servers is rate limited and it returns the value only if a subsequent call is made to the API, after the reset timeout or when the user just closes the chat screen (whichever is earlier). For an active issue, the reset timeout is 1 minute and 5 minutes for inactive issues.
