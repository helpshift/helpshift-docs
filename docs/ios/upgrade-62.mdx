## List of deprecated APIs {#deprecated-api}

| Deprecated API                                | New API                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [HelpshiftSupport log:(NSString *), ...>]     | [HelpshiftSupport addLog:(NSString *)]          |
| [HelpshiftCampaigns getCountOfUnreadMessages] | [HelpshiftCampaigns requestUnreadMessagesCount] |
|                                               |                                                 |

## Add Logs {#add-logs}

On SDK version 6.2.0 or below, the logs can be added using below code:

```
- (void) userUpdatedSomeSetting:(NSString *)settingName {
    ...
    [HelpshiftSupport log:@"User updated setting: %@", settingName];
    ...
}
```

On SDK version 6.3.0, a new api is introduced to add logs which is also Swift compatible

```
- (void) userUpdatedSomeSetting:(NSString *)settingName {
    ...
    NSString *message = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"User updated setting: %@", settingName];
    [HelpshiftSupport addLog:message];
    ...
}
```
