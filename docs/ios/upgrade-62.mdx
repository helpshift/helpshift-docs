## Add Logs {#add-logs}
On SDK version 6.2.0 or below, the logs can be added using below code:

```
- (void) userUpdatedSomeSetting:(NSString *)settingName {
    ...
    [HelpshiftSupport log:@"User updated setting: %@", settingName];
    ...
}
```
On SDK version 6.3.0, a new api is introduced to add logs which is also Swift compatible
```
- (void) userUpdatedSomeSetting:(NSString *)settingName {
    ...
    NSString *message = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"User updated setting: %@", settingName];
    [HelpshiftSupport addLog:message];
    ...
}
```
