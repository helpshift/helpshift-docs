### Disk space

This is the amount of disk space the xcframework takes up.

The size of the xcframework is 47.4 MB for device and 15.7 MB for simulator.

The breakage is as follows:

| Architecture | Size (MB) Device | Size (MB) Simulator | 
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| arm64        |      21.8        |        4.2 MB       |
| armv7        |      21.1        |          NA         |
| i386         |       NA         |        4.1 MB       |
| x86_64       |       NA         |        4.2 MB       |

When an iOS app is integrated with Helpshift xcframework, the increase in the size of IPA file is around `2.2` MB for both bitcode and non-bitcode versions of the xcframework.

If your app is not already using swift, there will be `4.4` MB size addition in the final downloaded IPA for OS versions below iOS 12.2.

### Disk Space

This is the amount of disk space the static library takes up.

The total size of library is 24.8 MBs.

The breakage is as follows:

| Architecture | Size (MB) |
|--------------|-----------|
| arm64        | 6.4       |
| armv7        | 4.6       |
| armv7s       | 4.6       |
| simulator    | 9.2       |

When included in an app, Helpshift library and all it resources will add around `2.15` MB size.
If you are using the bitcode version of the library then Helpshift adds around `2.15` MB size.

### iOS 6 deprecation

Starting with SDK version 5.x, we officially dropped support for iOS 6.
But we had kept the code handling the differences in platforms iOS 6 and below.
With SDK version 5.6.0 and above, we have now removed all handling in our code so running your application on iOS 6 is likely to cause runtime crashes and bad behaviour.

## 5.5.0

## 5.3.0

### SDK payload in your app

The combined library size (libSupport.a) is 15.8 MB.
The breakup is as follows:

| Architecture              | Size (MB) |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| i386 + x86_64 (simulator) | 5.8       |
| armv7                     | 3         |
| armv7s                    | 3         |
| arm64                     | 4         |

When compiled with an app for deployment on the app store, armv7, armv7s and arm64 will be taken up and i386+x86_64 or the simulator architectures will be ignored.


### Sample compiled payload size using a demo app {#demoapp-payload-size}

Helpshift SDK would add about 1.3 MB to your app's bundle.

### SDK memory usage {#memory-usage}

Memory usage for the SDK support screen launches.
Helpshift's install call will add around 1.2 MB of memory usage to your
app.


<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Memory usage tested with a demo app. Usage will increase with number of FAQs and
number of messages in a conversation.

| Support API launch | Memory Usage (approx. MB) |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| showConversation  | 5 MB |
| showFAQs | 7.9 MB |
| showFAQSection | 7 MB |
| showSingleFAQ (depending on the content of the FAQ) | 5 - 10 MB |
