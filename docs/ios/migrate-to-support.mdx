# Migration guide to Support SDK from Campaigns SDK

To migrate from Campaigns SDK to Support SDK please follow the steps mentioned below -

## Cocoapods Integration:

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

If you are using the Campaigns SDK and want to upgrade to Support SDK then we highly recommend you to upgrade to our [latest version](https://developers.helpshift.com/ios/getting-started#cocoapods).

</Admonition>

- Remove all API calls made in your Xcode project which are related to Campaigns feature.
- In order to migrate from campaigns SDK to same version of support SDK, please modify your Podfile as follows -

  `pod 'Helpshift', 'version-withCampaigns'` → `pod 'Helpshift', 'version'` # For normal version

  `pod 'Helpshift', 'version-withCampaigns-bitcode'` → `pod 'Helpshift', 'version-bitcode'` # For bitcode version

  For Example - If you are migrating from `7.8.0-withCampaigns-bitcode` then just replace it with `7.8.0-bitcode`.

- After integrating Support SDK, make sure you add correct install call. Use `[HelpshiftCore initializeWithProvider:[HelpshiftSupport sharedInstance]];` instead of `[HelpshiftCore initializeWithProvider:[HelpshiftAll sharedInstance]];`.
