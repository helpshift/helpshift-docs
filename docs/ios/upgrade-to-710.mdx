## xcframework packaging for SDK {#xcframework-packaging}

With version 7.10.0, Helpshift SDK is packaged as a xcframework rather than a single dynamic framework. Please follow the steps mentioned here if you are migrating from an older version of Helpshift SDK.

### Manual Integration

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

For SDK versions below 7.8.0, follow the steps mentioned in the “Manual integration” section [here.](https://developers.helpshift.com/ios/upgrade-to-78/#framework-packaging)

</Admonition>

1. Remove all Helpshift SDK related files from the project. These include -
   - Helpshift.framework
   - Helpshift.framework from Copy Files section from the Build Phases of your app
   - Remove the Helpshift specific `Run script` section referencing the `strip_frameworks.sh` script inside the Helpshift.framework.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

No changes are needed for custom theming plists and custom localization bundle when migrating. The old theming files and localization bundle will continue to work as expected.

</Admonition>

### Cocoapods Integration

1. From 7.10.0, Helpshift will require Cocoapods v1.10.0 and above for supporting xcframework.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

For SDK versions below 7.8.0, follow the steps mentioned in the “cocopods integration” section [here.](https://developers.helpshift.com/ios/upgrade-to-78/#framework-packaging)
