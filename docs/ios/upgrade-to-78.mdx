# Upgrading to 7.8.0 and above {#upgrade-to-780}

<Intro>

The Helpshift SDK v7.8.0 is a major update and we have made some important changes. If you have questions or feedback, please <a href="https://support.helpshift.com/kb/contact/" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>

</Intro>

## Framework packaging for SDK {#framework-packaging}

With version 7.8.0, Helpshift SDK is packaged as a dynamic framework rather than a static library. Please follow the steps mentioned here if you are migrating from an older version of Helpshift SDK.

### Manual Integration

1. Remove all Helpshift SDK related files from the project. These include -
   - HelpshiftSupport.h
   - HelpshiftCore.h
   - HsUIResourceBundle.bundle
   - HsLocalization.bundle
   - HelpshiftConfig.plist
   - HelpshiftConfigDark.plist

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

No changes are needed for custom theming plists and custom localization bundle when migrating. The old theming files and localization bundle will continue to work as expected.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

In case you have made changes to HelpshiftConfig.plist or HelpshiftConfigDark.plist, please rename the files to HelpshiftCustomConfig.plist and HelpshiftCustomConfigDark.plist respectively.

</Admonition>

2. Remove `/usr/lib/swift` from runpath search paths in the build settings, if other SDKs in your app don’t need it
3. Remove `$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift-5.0/$(PLATFORM_NAME)` and `$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift/$(PLATFORM_NAME)` from `Library Search Paths` in the build settings, if other SDKs in your app don’t need it
4. Ensure `Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries` is set to YES in the build settings
   After doing these, please follow the steps [here](/ios/getting-started#manual-integration) to integrate the framework version of the SDK.

### Cocoapods Integration

After updating your podfile to use v7.8.0 of Helpshift SDK and running `pod install`, perform the following steps -

1. Remove `/usr/lib/swift` from runpath search paths in the build settings, if other SDKs in your app don’t need it
2. Remove `$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift-5.0/$(PLATFORM_NAME)` and `$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift/$(PLATFORM_NAME)` from `Library Search Paths` in the build settings, if other SDKs in your app don’t need it
3. Ensure `Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries` is set to YES in the build settings

### Code changes

#### Objective C App
