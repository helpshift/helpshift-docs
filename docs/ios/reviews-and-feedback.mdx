## Manually show App Rating alertview {#app-rating-api}

Starting with SDK version 6.2.0, this feature has been deprecated. An explanation of why we made this change can be found [here](#review-reminder-changes).

## Automatic app ratings {#automatic-review-request}

Starting with SDK version 6.2.0, this feature has been deprecated. An explanation of why we made this change can be found [here](#review-reminder-changes).

## Changes in Automatic app ratings and Manual show app rating features {#review-reminder-changes}

The new review API from Apple ([details](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skstorereviewcontroller/2851536-requestreview)) lets end users leave app ratings on the App Store without leaving the app. However, it also caps the maximum amount of such requests to 3 per year. End users can in turn choose to disable app review requests from the app settings on their device.

Recently, Apple has mandated the usage of this new API, and also discouraged the usage of custom app review request prompts. As a result of this change in Apple’s app store policy, Helpshift has deprecated its review request API `showAlertToRateAppWithURL:withCompletionBlock:` in v6.2.0.

If you plan to support the new Apple review API and would still like the option to request reviews after Issue resolutions, your developer can use our ["CSAT completed" delegate](#csat) and call the review API if an end user has given their conversation a rating of 4 or 5 stars.

## Customer satisfaction survey {#csat}

Customer satisfaction survey prompts your app users to rate their customer support experience with your agents. Enabling it, sends out a 5-star customer service rating request to your customers when an issue is resolved.

To enable it, go to Settings in your agent dashboard, and then under app settings, select your app. You can enable `Customer satisfaction survey` from under SDK Configurations.

When an issue is resolved, and your customer accepts the resolution, then a Customer Satisfaction screen is shown.

Your customer can also (optionally) give feedback to help you improve the quality of your service.
