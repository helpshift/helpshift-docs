# Troubleshooting {#troubleshoot}

## SDK integration {#integration-issues}

### 7.9.0 SDK Update {#7}

We found a bug for the following scenario - for SDK 7.9.0, when New Issue Automations(NIAs) are used to assign to a Custom Bot and if the first step in the bot is a Get Info from User step with Options, the Options don’t show up to the end user till they go back and come to the conversation screen again.

**Action needed:**

- If you are planning to integrate or are in the process of integrating SDK 7.9.0, we recommend integrating with 7.9.1 instead.
- If you have already released any of your apps with the affected SDKs and your New Issue Automation triggers options bot, we recommend that you upgrade to [7.9.1 SDK](/ios/release-notes#7.9.1).

### Using Xcode 11 {#xcode11}

If you are migrating to Xcode 11 for building and deploying your app, please note that Helpshift SDKs < `7.6.3` will not be able to support Apple Push notifications. This is due to the change in the NSData class's `description` property. The Helpshift SDK uses this property in the device token that is passed by the App in the `[HelpshiftCore registerDeviceToken:]` API. Please wait for version `7.6.3` which is slated to release on the 10th of October, 2019. More details are available [in the Apple forum thread](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/119111).

### Crash while force unwrapping optional values in swift {#nil-crash-swift}

If your app crashes with following stack trace when you call an Helpshift SDK API with an Optional param which is nil, you can add nullability annotation to that API in .h file to allow nil values.

```objc
Fatal error: Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value.
```

For Example:

```objc
+ (void) setTheme:(NSString *)themeName;
```

should be changed to

```objc
+ (void) setTheme:(NSString *__nullable)themeName;
```

### Managing Helpshift SDK updates with Cocoapods

Due to the way Cocoapods handles version updates, if you have your own **custom localized strings**, note that, on the next SDK release they will be overwritten. Make sure you backup your translations, so you can migrate the values back into the new string files. One way of doing that might be to add these customizations in the version control system. That way when you upgrade Helpshift, you can see the `diff` of the changes that you made and reinstate them as you require.

### Unable to run Helpshift Integration Assistant {#integration-assistant-settings}

To run Helpshift Integration Assistant, you need to update your Security and Privacy Settings.
To do so, goto `System Preferences -> Security and Privacy Settings -> General` and select `Anywhere` under `Allow apps downloaded from`:

### hs_setContentInsetAdjustmentBehaviorToAutomaticWithParent crash {#setContentInsetAdjustmentBehaviorToAutomaticWithParent}

If you are seeing app crash just after launching Helpshift Support screens, please add -ObjC flag to the Other Linker Flags under Build Settings section.

```objc
*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception
reason: '-[UITableView hs_setContentInsetAdjustmentBehaviorToAutomaticWithParent:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x7fafe8837c00'
```

### CFBundleShortVersionString crash {#CFBundleShortVersionString}

If you are seeing app crashes just after launching the app, please make sure to set the **CFBundleShortVersionString** (Bundle versions string, short) in the **<YOUR_APP\>-Info.plist** file of your XCode project.

```objc
*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidArgumentException,

libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException
```

### Incorrect iOS initialization code crash {#initialization-crash}

If just after launching the app, you get a crash that has `readLocalConfig` in it's call stack, then make sure that you're using the correct Helpshift initialization code for iOS.
When testing again, after using the correct initialization code, delete the app from your device or simulator and do a fresh install.

### Orientation Fix {#orientation-fix}

To account for the changes in iOS 6 and above with autorotation and interface orientations, we suggest a few precautionary measures to avoid issues with the Helpshift SDK.

The Helpshift SDK uses `UIImagePickerController`, which according to
[Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIImagePickerController_Class/UIImagePickerController/UIImagePickerController.html)
supports portrait mode **only**.
This means if the interface orientations supported by your application do
not include portrait mask, then while choosing a screenshot the
application will crash.

**So please make sure that your application's list of supported interface orientations does not exclude portrait out.**

To give you an idea, if you add something like this to your application
delegate, it will avoid the crash.

```objc
-(NSUInteger)application:(UIApplication*)application supportedInterfaceOrientationsForWindow:(UIWindow*)window{
     return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskAll;
}

-(BOOL)shouldAutorotate{
     return NO;
}
```

You can still adjust your viewcontrollers for landscape only.
However the application needs to allow portrait mask to support
screenshot requests.

You can also allow portrait mode by changing your app's Info.plist file.

It again depends upon your application how you implement these
requirements.

### Missing chat bubbles in conversation screen {#missing-chat-bubbles}

If you encounter a conversation screen, where the chat bubbles are missing, or camera icon is missing, then make sure to correctly import the png files from the HSResources folder into your project.
![](/static/books/ios/no-chat-bubbles.png)

<Image src="/static/books/ios/import-hs-resources.png" width="full" />{" "}

### Strings missing in the SDK UI {#strings-missing-in-sdk}

If you cannot see strings in the SDK UI, make sure to correctly add localizable string files to your project. The files are to be found in `HSLocalization` folder. For more info, refer our [Going International](/ios/i18n/) guide.

![](/static/books/ios/no-strings-found.jpg)

## Notifications {#notifications-troubleshoot}

### Push Notifications {#push-notifications-troubleshoot}

To setup push notifications, check out the [Notifications](/ios/notifications/) doc.

Things to check when you're not receiving push notifications:

- Make sure that you've uploaded the correct .p12 file for development/production push modes.
  For more info check [here](/ios/notifications#configure-helpshift-push-admin).
- Make sure you're using the `registerDeviceToken:` API, in your `application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:` delegate method.
- Check that the app identifier you're using is the one used for your push certificate.
- Check whether you're have the correct **Code Signing** setup for the app identifier.
- Make sure that you're registering the app to use push notifications, using `registerForRemoteNotificationTypes` (`registerForRemoteNotifications` in iOS 8) in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` delegate method.
- If badge count is not showing up with push, make sure that in the agent dashboard, **Send Badge Count** is selected under **App Settings > Push Notification**. <Image src="/static/books/ios/enable-badge-count-push.png"  width="full" />
- If custom sound alerts are not working, make sure that **Custom Sound Alert** is selected under **App Settings > Push Notifications**. Also, provide the sound file name (with the file extension) exactly as the file name used in your app. <Image src="/static/books/ios/custom-sound-alert-push.png"  width="full" />
- To configure your app to handle notifications from Helpshift, check out the [configuration doc](/ios/notifications#configure-helpshift-sdk).

### Campaign notification shows "Support" as its title.

Please make sure to set the _"CFBundleDisplayName"_ key, in your application's _Info.plist_ file, to the display name of your application.

Helpshift SDK uses the value of this key as the title of the notification. If this key isn't set then the notification by default shows "Support" as the title.

### Testing push notifications for an App already in Production {#test-push-production}

There may be a need to test push notifications for an app that is already in production. This needs to be done safely without causing a disruption of Push Notifications in the production app. The solution here is to register a new app on our dashboard and have your in-development iOS app point to this new app on Helpshift. To configure push for this dashboard app, navigate to 'Push notifications settings' on the dashboard and turn it on. You will also need to provide a certificate.

If you are using the new Universal Push Notification system, upload the same certificate you have used in the production app and select the 'Development mode' radio button.

If you have not moved to Universal Push Notification system, upload a development mode certificate and make sure you have selected the 'Development mode' radio button.

## Theming and skinning {#skinning}

Things to check if skinning is not working as expected:

- Make sure that `HelpshiftConfig.plist` is correctly imported into your Xcode project. It should shown under **Build Phases > Copy Bundle Resources** for your target. <Image src="/static/books/ios/plist-added-correctly.png"  width="full" /> To make sure that your project is picking up the plist correctly, you can run the following snippet in your project:

```objc
        NSString *filePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"HelpshiftConfig" ofType:@"plist"];
        NSLog(@"%@",filePath);
```

If it is printing `null` etc. then the `HelpshiftConfig.plist` file is not correctly added to your project.

- Colors are specified in hexadecimal format, e.g. `FF0000` is Red. Do not use <del>`0xFF0000`</del> or <del>`#FF0000`</del> to specify color values.
- If you're using `UIAppearance` for a particular UI element, then you will not need to configure that UI element in `HelpshiftConfig.plist`, as Helpshift takes on UIAppearance values automatically.
- When using custom fonts make sure that you're using the exact font name. For more info check [here](/ios/design#custom-fonts).

## Miscellaneous {#misc}

### App crashing on foreground during `getAcceptLangHeaderValue:` or `completeEventsDataForEventDTOs:`

If you are using iOS SDK version 7.4.0 or below and are seeing crashes during app foreground with a similar stacktrace, please upgrade the SDK to version 7.5.0 or above.

```objc
    objc_retain + 16
    -[HsBaseNetwork getAcceptLangHeaderValue] + 48`

```

## Known issues {#known-issues}

### UILabel allocation in iOS 7 {#memory-allocation-ios7}

Apple has a bug with the UILabel component which causes it's allocation to be persisted in the
stack. We've minimized the effect as much as possible and reported the
issue to Apple.
For more details on the root issue, please [refer here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19568083/uilabel-allocation-persistent-and-taking-up-8mb-of-memory)

### For Crittercism users {#crittercism-users}

If you're using Crittercism for crash analytics and facing issues related to FAQ's content not loading, do not use the following API to initialize Crittercism.

```objc
+ (void)enableWithAppID:(NSString *)appId;
```

As described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/19283645) use,

```objc
+ (void)enableWithAppID:(NSString *)appId
            andDelegate:(id <CrittercismDelegate>)critterDelegate
          andURLFilters:(NSArray *)filters
 disableInstrumentation:(BOOL)disableInstrumentation;
```

### iPad iOS 7 Attaching a Screenshot {#attach-screenshot}

A bug exists in `iOS 7.0.3` on the iPad caused by tapping `'Ok,Attach'` in
the screenshot request (_this happens only for the first time after app install_).

This is a known issue. Please
[refer here](http://openradar.appspot.com/15077496)

`UIImagePicker` controller crashes when asking the user to grant photo access.
If you get a crash showing a stack trace similar to the one below, it's
the aforementioned bug causing the crash.

```objc

### Hidden status bar on orientation change in iOS 8 {#Hidden-status-bar}

On iOS 8, Helpshift SDK's navigation bar covers status bar after a change of orientation. To fix this, implement following method in the viewController that makes use of Helpshift API.

```objc
    // Add this Method in your viewController
- (BOOL)prefersStatusBarHidden {
    // return YES or NO as you want to hide status bar or not
    return NO;
}
```

### Images not loading in FAQs and Conversations for iOS 9 {#ios9-issue}

**Root Cause : ** Apple has changed its policies regarding TLS versions and only accepts connections which support TLSv1.2 SSL. Some of our backend servers do not currently work well with this restriction due to which the network calls fail and images do not load.

**Workaround : ** App developers will temporarily have to disable this restriction by adding the following lines to the app's Info.plist file

<Image src="/static/books/ios/troubleshoot-ios9.png" width="full" />{" "}

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
    <dict>
        <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
        <true/>
    </dict>
```

### Crashes due to error reporting {#error-reporting-crash}

If you are experiencing crashes or reduced instances being reported in your crash reporting tool, it is likely because of Helpshift Error reporting tool can’t forward the error/crash details to your crash reporting tool. We have experienced this with HockeyApp, SplunkMint and several crash reporting tools which use PlCrashReporter platform.
You can disable our crash reporting using the flag **disableErrorLogging**.

For example :/

```objc
NSDictionary *installConfig = @{@"disableErrorLogging" : @"yes"};

[Helpshift installForApiKey:@"apikey" domainName:@"domain_name" appID:@"app_id" withOptions:installConfig];
```

### Crashes due to missing data in App's Info.plist {#error-reporting-crash}

Helpshift SDK adds some meta data (like app's version number, name etc.) along with the conversations that users start. The SDK reads this info from the app's Info.plist file. Some of these fields are mandatory and may cause a crash if left emtpy. Please ensure that the following values are always populated in your Info.plist:

- Bundle versions string
- Bundle name
- Bundle identifier

### Xcode12.3 integration build error : Building for iOS, but the embedded framework ‘Helpshift.framework’ was built for iOS + iOS Simulator. {#Xcode12}

**Workaround : ** Under Build Settings - Navigate to Validate Workspace - Toggle setting back to Yes/No but not to Yes (Error).

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

If the flag is already set to Yes/No, set it to “Yes” and then set it to “No” again or vice versa.
Due to a bug in Xcode 12.3, this setting is visible in Xcode but isn’t actually present in the project file.
