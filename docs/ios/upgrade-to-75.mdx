# Upgrading to 7.5.0 and above {#upgrade-to-750}

<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

When upgrading to 7.5.x, please replace all the old files with new files. If you have made changes in the `HelpshiftLocalizable.strings` or `HelpshiftConfig.plist` file, please make sure to port over those changes to the new versions.

If you are looking to upgrade from a version older than 7.x, please make sure to go through the Upgrade guides for 6.x, 6.2, 6.0 and 5.x

#### Integration-related changes

##### Manual integration

When you integrate SDK manually, remove all the old SDK files and add the Standard SDK zip file in your app.
[Integration Guide](/ios/getting-started#manual-integration)

##### Cocoapods

If you are using cocoapods for integration, then there is no need to update or modify any file.
[Integration Guide](/ios/getting-started#cocoapods)

#### Code-related changes

If your code-base has references to `Campaigns` code, then the compilation fails after the upgrade. You will need to remove all the references to `Campaigns` code from the code-base.

Following are the changes:

1. Remove any `HelpshiftCampaigns.h` imports.
2. Remove any `HelpshiftAll.h` imports.
3. Remove any `HelpshiftInbox.h` imports.
4. Replace `[HelpshiftCore initializeWithProvider:[HelpshiftAll sharedInstance]]` call with `[HelpshiftCore initializeWithProvider:[HelpshiftSupport sharedInstance]]` call.

## Drop iOS 9 support

With version 7.5.0, Helpshift SDK has dropped support for iOS 9. If you wish to keep supporting iOS 9 devices for your apps, please read the [KB Article](https://support.helpshift.com/kb/article/what-are-the-minimum-ios-versions-supported-by-helpshift/) to support Helpshift on older OS versions.
