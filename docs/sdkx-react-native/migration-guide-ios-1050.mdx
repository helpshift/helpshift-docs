## iOS Migration - SDK X 10.5.0 {#ios-migration-10-5-0}

We have updated the Helpshift iOS SDK to version 10.5.0. This update involves several API removals and deprecations in the native layer that are reflected in the React Native plugin.

### SDK Termination on iOS 14 and below {#ios-14-termination}

Helpshift SDK X 10.5.0 will now officially support only iOS 15 and above. We have stopped technical support for iOS 14 and below. The SDK will remain compile-able on these versions, but functionality might be broken.

### API Deprecations {#api-deprecations}

The following APIs have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

- **Notification Handling APIs**: The old way of passing notification data to the SDK using `handlePush` is being replaced by more robust native delegates and specialized handlers on iOS.
  - Deprecated API: `handlePush`
  - Replacement: Use the new improved notification handling pattern. Refer to the [Notifications iOS](/sdkx-react-native/notifications-ios) page for details on how to use `handleIOSForegroundNotification`, `handleIOSNotificationClick`, and `handleIOSSilentNotification`.
- **Outbound Support**: The entire Outbound Support feature is deprecated in favor of the new Proactive Engagement feature.
  - Deprecated API: `handleProactiveLink`
  - Replacement: Use Proactive Engagement via the Helpshift Dashboard. Refer to the [Proactive Engagement](/sdkx-react-native/proactive-engagement) page.

### New Native Delegates for Push Notifications {#new-push-delegates}

For better control over notifications and to support Proactive Engagement, we have introduced new native delegate methods that should be implemented in your `AppDelegate`. These are essential for the new React Native notification handlers to function correctly.

Refer to the [Notifications iOS](/sdkx-react-native/notifications-ios#push-delegates) documentation for implementation details.

### Proactive Engagement Integration {#proactive-engagement-integration}

To adopt the new Proactive Engagement feature:
- Use the new `setProactiveConfig` API if you wish to provide fallback configurations.
- Ensure you have a Notification Service Extension if you want to support rich push notifications (images).
- Refer to the [Proactive Engagement](/sdkx-react-native/proactive-engagement) guide for a complete overview.
