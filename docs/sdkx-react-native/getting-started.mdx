# Getting Started {#getting-started}

<Intro>

You're 3 steps away from adding great in-app support to your React Native application.

</Intro>

Guide to integrating the React Native plugin for the Helpshift SDK X. You can also refer `helpshift-plugin-sdkx-react-native` package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helpshift-plugin-sdkx-react-native).

## Requirements {#version-requirements}

- Node v16 or above
- Android Studio
- Xcode 13 or above
- Java 11 or above

## Installation {#adding-to-project}

Open a Terminal in your project's folder and run:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```npm
$ npm i helpshift-plugin-sdkx-react-native
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```yarn 
$ yarn add helpshift-plugin-sdkx-react-native
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

- Additionaly for iOS platform there is a requirement to link the native parts of the library: 

```$ npx pod-install```

- After that, re-run your react application and start using Helpshift SDKX functions.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Here you can validate that the `helpshift-plugin-sdkx-react-native` package should be added to the `package.json` 
```javascript
"dependencies": {
    .....
    "helpshift-plugin-sdkx-react-native": <plugin-sdkx-version>,
    .....
  },
```
</Admonition>

### For iOS: Info.plist changes: Addition of usage description strings {#plist-description-strings}

When the “User Attachments” feature is enabled from the In-app SDK Configuration section, the SDK allows the user to upload the attachments. The attachments can be picked up from the Photo Library or Files. The options for these sources look like:

<Image src="/static/books/react-native/attachment_picker_ios.png" width="half" />{" "}

To use the photo library, Apple requires the app to have Usage Description strings in the Info.plist while. Failing to add these strings might result in app rejection. The following strings are needed for the attachment feature:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Suggested string</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</td>
    <td>
      “We need to access photos library to allow users manually pick images
      meant to be sent as an attachment for help and support reasons.”
    </td>
    <td>
      This is not needed if your app is iOS 11 or above. Below iOS 11, this key
      is compulsory else the app may crash when user tries to open the photo
      library for attaching photos.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that the above strings are just a suggested description. If you need localisations for the same, please [Contact Us](https://support.helpshift.com/hc/en/13-helpshift-technical-support/contact-us/?p=all&contact=1)

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

End-users can attach files such as pdf, video, etc in their issues. For iOS 10 and below, to access files in the “Files” app of iOS, developers will need to add iCloud capability with iCloud Documents services enabled. For more info please refer the [Prerequisites section here.](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/DocumentPickerProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014451)

## Initializing Helpshift in your app {#initializing}

1. First, create an app on the Helpshift Dashboard

   <Image src="/static/books/helpshiftx/add_app.png" width="full" />{" "}

2. Create an app with **Android** and **iOS** as selected `Platform`
   <Image
     src="/static/books/helpshiftx/create_app_with_android_platform.png"
     width="full"
   />{" "}

Helpshift uniquely identifies each registered App with a combination of 2 tokens:

<div className=" compact">

|                          |                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <code>Domain Name</code> | Your Helpshift domain. E.g. _happyapps.helpshift.com_                                      |
| <code>Platform ID</code> | Your App's unique Platform ID (App's <code>App ID</code> on dashboard is your Platform ID) |
| <code>Config</code>      | Config <code>object</code> representing the configuration parameters for the installation. |
</div>

You can find these by navigating to `Settings`>`SDKs (for Developers)` in your agent dashboard.
Select your App and _check `Android` and `iOS` as a platform_ from the dropdowns and copy
the 2 tokens to be passed when initializing Helpshift.

<Image src="/static/books/helpshiftx/copy_install_keys.png"  width="full" />


Initialize SDK by calling `install` method before any other interaction with the Helpshift SDK in `App.tsx`.(It should be used in the `useEffect` hook in react native call). For more details [click here](/sdkx-react-native/sdk-configuration)

### Initialize
```javascript
import {
  install
} from 'helpshift-plugin-sdkx-react-native';

let installConfig = {
  'enableLogging': true,
  'manualLifecycleTracking': false
}
let appId = Platform.select({
  android: <Android_Platform_ID>,
  ios: <iOS_Platform_ID>,
});

if (appId != null) {
  install(appId, <domain>, installConfig);
} else {
  //Display your error here.
}
```

## Start using Helpshift {#start-using}

Helpshift is now integrated with your app. You should now use the support APIs for [conversation screens](/sdkx-react-native/support-tools#conversation-view) inside your app.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Since the Helpshift plugin is meant for mobile devices only, you should put all Helpshift calls inside conditional checks to make sure they are only called when running on a device.
