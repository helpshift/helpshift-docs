# Set SDK language {#language-change-programatically}

<SetLanguageDescription />

For example : `setLanguage('fr')`

```javascript
import { setLanguage } from "helpshift-plugin-sdkx-react-native";
```

Setting SDK language for the given locale with only language code.

```javascript
setLanguage("fr");
```

Setting the SDK language for the given locale with both language code and country code.

```javascript
setLanguage("zh-SG");
```

Here's a screenshot of how SDK will look after setting the language to French.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

- The default language is set to English (`en`) i.e. if you don't set any language using the `setLanguage("<language-code>")` API, SDK will use English as the language.
- All language codes are case-sensitive.
