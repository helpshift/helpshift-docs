# Upgrading from 2.x to 3.x {#upgrade-to-3x}

<Intro>

The Helpshift SDK v3.x is a major update that unifies the Report an Issue and Issues Inbox into a single Conversation interface. We've also cleaned up our API calls. If you have questions or feedback, please <a href="https://support.helpshift.com/kb/contact/" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>

</Intro>

## Upgrading {#upgrading}

1. Download the latest Helpshift SDK [here](https://d3e51fp79zp4el.cloudfront.net/library/latest/android/helpshift-android-sdk.zip).
1. Follow the instructions on [Adding the latest stable release of the SDK to your project](/android/getting-started#add-to-project)
1. **Important Note**: **From v3.x, all Helpshift calls are now static.**
   You no longer need to initialize the helpshift object. You can directly use `Helpshift.install(...);`. `Helpshift.showFAQs(...);` now presents the full support screen. **hs.showReportIssue(...);** is no longer available. Use `Helpshift.showConversation(...);` instead.
1. Replace any other API calls which are no longer available with the new ones below.
1. You're now good to go with Helpshift SDK v3.x.

## What changed {#what-changed}

- We've cleaned up our API calls to be more descriptive and more
  consistent across our iOS and Android SDKs. Basic implementation has
  been simplified to Contact Us and FAQ use cases
  (`Helpshift.showConversation(...);` and `Helpshift.showFAQs(...);` respectively).

- Make it easier for your app users to contact you when they are in
  trouble. There's a flag to persist Contact Us across all FAQ screens

- No more issue inbox, we've unified the conversation interface into a
  single channel. The UI is simpler for app users. They always know
  where to get in touch with you or continue the conversation.

- If app users find your FAQ not helpful, they can contact you to tell
  you why.

- Updated strings and translations.
