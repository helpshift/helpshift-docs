# Impact Analysis {#performance}

<Intro>

The following numbers are representative of a skeletal sample app
integrated with the Helpshift Android SDK.

</Intro>

## v7.11.0

### SDK payload in your app {#payload-size}

The Helpshift Android SDK will add 1.92 MB to your application's release APK. This analysis was done with Android Gradle Plugin v3.4.2 and Gradle v5.1.1. The 1.92 MB size includes total impact with dependencies on Android Support Libraries (design, recycler-view and card-view). If your app already contains appcompat, design, recycler-view and cardview, the Helpshift SDK will add 1.46 MB.

### Method count {#methods-count}

The Helpshift Android SDK will add 9614 methods to your dex:

| Package                                                 | Method Count |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -----------: |
| **com.helpshift**                                       |       `9614` |
| **com.android.support:design:** (includes recyclerview) |       `6673` |

### Memory usage {#memory-usage}

Memory usage for the SDK screen launches.

| Support API launch                           | Memory Usage (approx. MB) |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------: |
