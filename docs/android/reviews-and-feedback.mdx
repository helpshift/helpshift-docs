Asking for reviews and feedback

</Intro>

## Review reminder in SDK {#review-reminder}

Helpshift SDK adds a way for customers to send feedback in review reminders.

The review reminder is shown if there is no on-going conversation with the user. It takes the user to [New Conversation](/android/support-tools#conversation-view) screen.

In this way, you can reduce possible negative reviews into genuine problems to be solved.

If you want to change the strings used in this alert view, head over to [String Customization](/android/string-customization/).

## Manual App Rating request{#app-rating-api}

Manual app rating requests can be triggered by using the `showAlertToRateApp` API.

Example:

```java
String playStoreUrl = "market://details?id=<package_name>";

// Create a AlertToRateAppListener which will get called when the
// user taps a button in the Alert Dialog
//
AlertToRateAppListener actionListener =  new AlertToRateAppListener() {
     @Override
     public void onAction(int action) {
       String msg = "";
       switch (action) {
       case Support.RateAlert.CLOSE:
         msg = "Close";
         break;
       case Support.RateAlert.FEEDBACK:
         msg = "Feedback";
         break;
       case Support.RateAlert.SUCCESS:
         msg = "Rate app";
         break;
       case Support.RateAlert.FAIL:
         msg = "Alert did not show";
         break;
       }
       Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), msg, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
     }
   };

Support.showAlertToRateApp(playStoreUrl, actionListener);
```

## Automatic review requests {#configure-review-request}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Not supported by SDK version 3.3.0 (only)

</Admonition>

Automatic review requests can be triggered on two kinds of events:

- after a specific number of app launches
- after a specific number of days since the first app launch

To enable automatic review requests, navigate to **SDK Configurations** for your app in agent dashboard and select a value from **Ask for review after every** dropdown.

Automatic review requests, if enabled via admin, will be shown **once per app version**.

## Customer satisfaction survey {#csat}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Applicable to SDK version 3.5.0 and above

</Admonition>

Customer satisfaction survey prompts your app users to rate their customer support experience with your agents. Enabling it, sends out a 5-star customer service rating request to your customers when an issue is resolved.

To enable it, go to Settings in your agent dashboard, and then under app settings, select your app. You can enable `Customer satisfaction survey` from under SDK Configurations.

When an issue is resolved, and your customer accepts the resolution, then a Customer Satisfaction screen is shown.

Your customer can also (optionally) give feedback to help you improve the quality of your service.

You can also update the review URL for your app via **SDK Configurations** in agent dashboard.
A google play store URL should look like `market://details?id=com.RunnerGames.game.YooNinja_Lite`.
