    1. Select your App from the dropdown and copy the three tokens to be passed when initializing Helpshift.

    Update `hs.install` call in your activity's `onCreate` method with these tokens.

1. Run the following inside the `/HelpshiftDemo` directory to start:

    
```text

        $ android update project -t android-17 -p .

```
