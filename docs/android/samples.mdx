## Trying out HelpshiftDemo {#support-app}

1. In `HelpshiftDemoActivity.java` initialize Helpshift with your unique `API_KEY`, `DOMAIN` and `APP_ID`. To get them:

   1. Navigate to `Settings`>`SDK (for Developers)` in your agent dashboard and scroll down to **"Initializing Helpshift"** section.

   1. Select your App from the dropdown and copy the three tokens to be passed when initializing Helpshift.

      <Image
        src="/static/books/common/settings-integration.png"
        width="major"
      />{" "}

   Update `hs.install` call in your activity's `onCreate` method with these tokens.

1. Run the following inside the `/HelpshiftDemo` directory to start:

```text

        $ android update project -t android-17 -p .

```

### Test your integration {#test-integration}

1. Tap **Contact Us** button in the sample app, you should see the [New Conversation](/android/support-tools#conversation-view) screen.

   ![HelpshiftDemo](/static/books/android/sample-app.png)

1. File an issue, and watch it appear in your agent dashboard. Once you've resolved that issue, you should go ahead and [Integrate Helpshift in your app](/android/getting-started/).
