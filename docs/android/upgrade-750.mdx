# Upgrading to 7.5.0 and above

<Intro>

In order to use SDK 7.5.0 for your app, Helpshift recommends you to follow the below steps. If you have questions or feedback, please <a href="https://support.helpshift.com/kb/contact/" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>

</Intro>

<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

If you are looking to upgrade from a version older than 7.x, please make sure to go through the upgrade guides for 6.x and 4.x

</Admonition>

### Integration-related changes

Download the SDK from [here](/android/getting-started#download-sdk).

You will need to update integration code to use "Support.getInstance()" in the Helpshift initialisation call.

### Code-related changes

If your codebase has references to `Campaigns` code, then the compilation fails after the upgrade. You will need to remove all the references to Campaigns code from the codebase.

Following are the changes:

1. Replace the `Core.install(All.getInstance())` call with `Core.install(Support.getInstance())`
2. Remove all references to `Campaigns` apis from code

## If you use Helpshift's English-only SDK

- You can trim the SDK to reduce the SDK size impact on your app further by using only resources of select languages.
- Follow the instructions as mentioned above to upgrade to 7.5.0 or above, depending on the type of SDK you use.
- The following gradle script allows you to keep only "english" and "french" resources and remove others from 3rd party libraries in the application.

```java
android {
	defaultConfig {
    ...
    resConfigs "en", "fr"
    }
}
```
