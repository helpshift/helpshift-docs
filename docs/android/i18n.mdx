# Going International {#going-international}

The Helpshift Android SDK supports 47 languages out of the box with
English as default. The translation strings used by the SDK can be
found in the `strings.xml` file, under the following folders -

If the end-user has a language already set for their device, the correct
language translations will be used. If the said language is not
available, English will be used by default.

To add your own language, you need to provide the translated strings
inside `strings.xml` under the appropriate folder. For example, in
order to support the Japanese language, you need to place `strings.xml`
with the translated strings under `values-ja` folder.

For more information, refer to
[Android's Language Support Guide](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/supporting-devices/languages.html)

# Selection of Languages {#language-selection}

If your application does not support all the above mentioned languages and you want to strip off the Helpshift resources to reduce APK size, use the `resConfigs` gradle flag in your app's `build.gradle` as follows:

```groovy

	android {
		defaultConfig {
			...
			resConfigs "en", "fr"
			...
		}
	}

```

For example, the above code snippet will only retain resources of English & French languages in your app. For more details, refer Android's guide [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code#unused-alt-resources)

# Set SDK language {#language-change-programatically}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Applicable to SDK v3.9.0 and above

</Admonition>

You can set the SDK language for the given locale using the method `setSDKLanguage`

Locale can contain two-letter lowercase ISO language codes (such as "en") as defined by ISO 639-1 and in addition contain two-letter uppercase ISO country codes (such as "US")as defined by ISO 3166-1. Language code and country code are separated by an underscore ("\_"). Example - "pt_BR", "zh_CN".

For example :

Setting SDK language for the given locale with only language code.

```.java
Core.setSDKLanguage("fr");
```

Setting the SDK language for the given locale with both language code and country code.

```.java
Core.setSDKLanguage("zh_CN");
```

Before you set the language, make sure that there exists translations for the Helpshift strings in that locale. List of supported locale is mentioned above.
If there is a locale which we currently do not support out of the box, please add the relevant translation files in your app.

Now, **head over to [String Customization](/android/string-customization/)** for the list of strings that you can customize as per your needs.
