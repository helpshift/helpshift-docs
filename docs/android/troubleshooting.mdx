# Troubleshooting {#troubleshoot}

## SDK Integration {#integration-issues}

### UI issue with Androidx libraries

We found a bug in following scenario when androidx fragment library is used by the client app:

- Conversation history is off or `enableFullPrivacy` flag is used when opening chat screen.
- Smart Intents are enabled.
- Resolve an ongoing conversation.
- Click "New Conversation" button.
- When new conversation starts, smart intents selection sheet is collapsed automatically and user is not able to select any option.

Androidx Fragment library, above version 1.2.0, has delayed the lifecyle callback of "onDestroyView" until transitions are completed.
This broke lifecycle management for the SDK and some UI glicthes were found.

To fix this issue, please disable transitions in the SDK by using the following config when initializing the SDK:

Only fragment transition animations will be disabled, all other animations will work as expected.

```java
InstallConfig.Builder config = new InstallConfig.Builder();

Map<String, Object> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("disableAnimations", true);
config.setExtras(map);

Core.install(this, "apiKey",
                   "domain",
                   "platformId",
                   config.build());
```

### 7.9.0 SDK Update {#7}

We found a bug for the following scenario - for SDK 7.9.0, when New Issue Automations(NIAs) are used to assign to a Custom Bot and if the first step in the bot is a Get Info from User step with Options, the Options don’t show up to the end user till they go back and come to the conversation screen again.

**Action needed:**

- If you are planning to integrate or are in the process of integrating SDK 7.9.0, we recommend integrating with 7.9.1 instead.
- If you have already released any of your apps with the affected SDKs and your New Issue Automation triggers options bot, we recommend that you upgrade to [7.9.1 SDK](/android/release-notes#v791).

### Duplicate class error for `apache/commons/codec/language`

If you get a dex error like below which indicates that the **apache/commons/codec/language** classes are being added to the app more than once

You can remove these classes from the _Helpshift.jar_ in two possible ways :

#### command line

```bash
    zip -d Helpshift.jar org/apache/commons/codec/language/**
```

#### custom ant task

```xml
<target name="clean-apache" >
  <mkdir dir="./backup"/>
  <copy file="./libs/Helpshift.jar" todir="./backup"/>
  <jar destfile="./libs/Helpshift-temp.jar">
    <zipfileset src="./libs/Helpshift.jar" excludes="org/apache/commons/codec/language/**"/>
  </jar>
  <rename src="./libs/Helpshift-temp.jar" dest="./libs/Helpshift.jar"/>
</target>
<target name="restore-helpshift" >
  <move file="./backup/Helpshift.jar" todir="./libs"/>
</target>
```

Once done you can run a `clean & compile`. As these classes are already included in your application lib; they will be compiled into the final APK build and will work fine with Helpshift.

### Dex merger error

If you get a dex merger error like below, enable the jumbo mode.

```text
    UNEXPECTED TOP-LEVEL EXCEPTION:
    com.android.dex.DexException: Cannot merge new index 68218 into a non-jumbo
    instruction!
```

To enable jumbo mode in Gradle add the following to your build.gradle -

```groovy
    android {
        dexOptions {
            jumboMode = true
        }
    }
```

To enable jumbo mode in Ant add the following to your project.properties -

```xml
    dex.force.jumbo=true
```

### Duplicate class error for `Lcom/helpshift/BuildConfig`

If you get a dex error like below,

```text
    UNEXPECTED TOP-LEVEL EXCEPTION:
    com.android.dex.DexException: Multiple dex files define
    Lcom/helpshift/BuildConfig;
```

This indicates that two **BuildConfig** files are getting added to the
App, once via the _Helpshift.jar_ file and then via the _helpshift-android-sdk_ resources

You can resolve this by deleting the **BuildConfig** file which comes with the Helpshift.jar by using the following command -

```bash
    zip -d Helpshift.jar com/helpshift/BuildConfig.class
```

### InflateException: Binary XML file: Error inflating class com.helpshift.views.HSTextInputEditText

If you get a crash with the following error, check the android support library version you use:

```text
    java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to resume activity {com.sampleimpactanalysis/com.helpshift.support.activities.ParentActivity}: android.view.InflateException:
    Binary XML file line #7: Binary XML file line #35: Error inflating class com.helpshift.views.HSTextInputEditText

    Suppressed: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Failed resolution of: Landroid/support/design/widget/TextInputEditText;

    Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "android.support.design.widget.TextInputEditText"
```

Helpshift SDK uses the "android.support.design.widget.TextInputEditText" class. Since this class was introduced in android support library v23.2.0, you would need to add dependencies for android support libraries equal to or higher than v23.2.0.

## Push notifications {#push-notifications}

In case the app is not receiving push notifications, you can look at the following sections.

### IP whitelisting

In order to receive push notifications from Helpshift, please note that that there should be no key restrictions on the key used with Helpshift. To ensure this:

- Click on the API key to be used with Helpshift on your Google console dashboard.
- Set the Key restriction option to `None`

## Multi-process apps {#multi-process-apps}

In a multi-process Android app, the Application.onCreate() is called for every process. As the Helpshift SDK is initialized inside the Application.onCreate() method of the app, multi-process apps will lead to multiple instances of the SDK being initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior. We recommend that the Helpshift SDK be initialized in the main process only. This can be done by checking the process name in which Application.onCreate() is called. You can refer to the example below for this:

```java
Application.onCreate() {
    ActivityManager activityManager = (ActivityManager) getSystemService(ACTIVITY_SERVICE);
    List<ActivityManager.RunningAppProcessInfo> infos = activityManager.getRunningAppProcesses();
    int myPid = android.os.Process.myPid();
    for (ActivityManager.RunningAppProcessInfo info : infos) {
        if (myPid == info.pid) {
        if (info.processName.equals(getApplicationInfo().packageName)) {
            // This is running in the main process of the app.
            Core.init(All.getInstance());
            try {
              Core.install(this,
                           "YOUR_API_KEY",
                           "YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME",
                           "YOUR_APP_ID",
                           installConfig);
            } catch (InstallException e) {
                Log.e(TAG, "invalid install credentials : ", e);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Miscellaneous {#miscellaneous}

### Helpshift Logs with low priority DEBUG

```text
    02-19 20:35:49.853: D/HelpShiftDebug(7651): org.json.JSONException: No value for pr
    02-19 20:35:49.853: D/HelpShiftDebug(7651): at org.json.JSONObject.get(JSONObject.java:354)
    02-19 20:35:49.853: D/HelpShiftDebug(7651): at
```

You can safely ignore the Helpshift SDK debug logs (log priority "DEBUG" / "Log.d") that are seen in DDMS / Android Monitor. These will not cause any issues with the proper functioning of the SDK.

### Helpshift Warning with low priority

```text
    03-13 16:49:52.667 30615-1447/? W/MessageQueue : Handler (com.helpshift.HSApiData$4){427f1eb8} sending message to a Handler on a dead thread
```

This is just a warning, and this has been handled by the helpshift SDK. You can safely ignore it. These will not cause any issues with the proper functioning of the SDK.

## UI Issues {#ui-issues}

### Cannot scroll FAQ list, cannot switch FAQ tabs, keyboard input not working when creating a new conversation etc.

These UI issues are caused when hardware acceleration is turned off for Helpshift's activities. To ensure that hardware acceleration is turned on, add this to your AndroidManifest.xml file.

```xml
    <activity
        android:name="com.helpshift.support.activities.ParentActivity"
        android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
        android:theme="@style/Helpshift.Theme.Activity"/>
```
