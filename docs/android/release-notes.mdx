# Release Notes

<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

With the transition to TLSv1.2 on Sep 20,2021, connections to a Helpshift SDK via any previous TLS version will not work as expected. Specifically, this means that:

- Helpshift SDKs will not work or load on lower-end Android devices (meaning, Android 4.x and earlier), because these lower-end Android versions do not support TLSv1.2.
- End-users on lower-end Android devices will not be able to access FAQs, raise new issues, or access their past support conversations.
- On a lower-end Android device, the mobile app that embeds a Helpshift SDK will be prevented from communicating with the SDK for any purpose. However, this disconnect will not cause any malfunction or crash on the parent application.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

- Use the latest sdk version.
- If you have released your app with `7.8.0` version, we highly recommend that you upgrade to `7.8.1` which fixes an important migration bug. Refer [here](/android/release-notes#v781).
- If you're currently using Android SDK `v7.7.0` or `v7.7.1` in your app, please update the SDK to `v7.7.2` which contains some important bug fixes. Check release notes for `v7.7.2`.
- If you have released your app with Android SDK `v7.7.0` and `v7.7.1` to production, please get in touch with us via support and make sure to upgrade to `v7.7.2` asap. Apologies for any inconvenience that this has caused.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

7.9.0 SDK Update

We found a Bug in SDK release 7.9.0 - Bot Options don't show up to end users when the Bot is triggered via New Issue Automation (NIA)

Note: The issue gets fixed when user closes and reopens the chat screen.

**Action needed:**

- If you are planning to integrate or are in the process of integrating SDK 7.9.0, we recommend integrating with 7.9.1 instead.
- If you have already released any of your apps with the affected SDKs and your New Issue Automation triggers options bot, we recommend that you upgrade to 7.9.1 SDK to be made available on November 3, 2020.

</Admonition>

_October 7, 2020_

- Helpshift Android SDK is now fully compatible with Android 11. We recommend you to use the latest SDK since apps using Older SDKs (<=7.8.1 version) will see the following degraded behavior for Helpshift messaging experience on Android 11 devices when the app’s targetSDKVersion is set to 30:

  - Image orientation changes on some Android 11 devices when the user uploads an image.
  - If the issue filing flow is form-based then menu items are not clickable on the form when the app is in full screen mode. [View Impact](/android/troubleshooting#known-issues)

  - Hyperlinks are broken in Action card, agent message and user message.
