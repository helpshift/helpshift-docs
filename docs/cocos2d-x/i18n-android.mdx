# Going International {#going-international}

The Helpshift Android SDK supports 33 languages out of the box with
English as default. The translation strings used by the SDK can be
found in the `strings.xml` file, under the following folders -

| Values        | Language            | Locale |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| values        | English             | en     |

| values-el     | Greek               | el     |
| values-da     | Danish              | da     |

| values-iw     | Hebrew              | iw     |
| values-sk     | Slovak              | sk     |
| values-uk     | Ukrainian           | uk     |
| values-ca     | Catalan             | ca     |
| values-hr     | Croatian            | hr     |

If the end-user has a language already set for their device, the correct
language translations will be used. If the said language is not
available, English will be used by default.

To add your own language, you need to provide the translated strings
inside `strings.xml` under the appropriate folder. For example, in
order to support the Japanese language, you need to place `strings.xml`
with the translated strings under `values-ja` folder.

# Set SDK language {#language-change-programatically}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Applicable to SDK v1.7.0 and above.

</Admonition>

You can set the SDK language for the given locale using the method `setLanguage`.

Locale can contain two-letter lowercase ISO language codes (such as "en") as defined by ISO 639-1 and in addition contain two-letter uppercase ISO country codes (such as "US") as defined by ISO 3166-1. Language code and country code are separated by an underscore ("\_"). Example - "pt_BR", "zh_CN".

For Example:
Setting language for the given locale with only language code.

```cpp

    HelpshiftCocos2dx::setLanguage("fr");

```

Setting the language for the given locale with both language code and country code.

```cpp

    HelpshiftCocos2dx::setLanguage("zh_CN");

```

Before you set the language, make sure that you have translations for the Helpshift strings in that locale. A list of supported locales is provided above. If there is a locale which we currently do not support out of the box, please add the relevant translation files in your app.
