# Migration guide to Support SDK from Campaigns SDK

To migrate from Campaigns SDK to Support SDK please follow the steps mentioned below -

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

If you are using the Campaigns SDK and want to upgrade to Support SDK then we highly recommend you to upgrade to our [latest version](https://developers.helpshift.com/cocos2d-x/getting-started-ios#getting-sdk).

</Admonition>

- Remove all Campaigns SDK related files added to your project. These can include -
  - Files added from `ios/Classes` folder.
  - `Helpshift.framework` or `Helpshift.xcframework` whichever you have added to your project from `ios/sdk` folder.
- Remove all API calls made in your project which are related to Campaigns feature.
- Add Support SDK to your project. If you are integrating same version of Support SDK as to Campaigns SDK then integration steps will be similar to how Campaigns SDK was integrated in your project. If you are integrating latest Support SDK please follow integration guide [here](https://developers.helpshift.com/cocos2d-x/getting-started-ios#getting-sdk).
