# Impact Analysis {#performance}

<Intro>

The following numbers are representative of a skeletal sample app
integrated with the Helpshift Cocos2dx plugin for iOS.

**App Launch Time**

Since all the Helpshift initialization takes place on a background thread, the Helpshift SDK does not affect app launch times.

## v5.6.0

### Disk space

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Tested with Cocos2d v3.17.2, Xcode 12 built demo app on iPhone X running iOS 14.0 . Usage will increase with number of FAQs and number of messages in a conversation.

</Admonition>

When an Cocos2dx iOS app is integrated with Helpshift xcframework, the increase in the size of IPA file is around `2.2 MB` for both bitcode and non-bitcode versions of the xcframework.

If your app is not already using Swift, there will be an additional `4.6 MB` size addition in the final downloaded IPA for OS versions below iOS 12.2.
