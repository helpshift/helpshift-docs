## xcframework packaging for SDK {#xcframework-packaging}

With version 5.6.0, Helpshift SDK is packaged as a xcframework rather than a single dynamic framework. Please follow the steps mentioned here if you are migrating from an older version of Helpshift SDK.

### Manual Integration

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

For SDK versions below 5.4.0, follow the steps mentioned in the "Manual integration" section on [here.](/cocos2d-x/upgrade-5.4.0-ios/#framework-packaging)

</Admonition>

1. Remove all Helpshift SDK related files from the project. These include -
   - Helpshift.framework
   - Helpshift.framework from Copy Files section from the Build Phases of your app
   - Remove the Helpshift specific `Run script` section referencing the `strip_frameworks.sh` script inside the Helpshift.framework.
   - Remove all wrapper files for Helpshift SDK from the project, which are added from `ios/Classes` folder present in Helpshift Cocos2d-x package.
2. Remove `@loader_path/Frameworks` from Runpath Search Paths section in the build settings, if other SDKs in your app donâ€™t need it.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

No changes are needed for custom theming plists and custom localization bundle when migrating. The old theming files and localization bundle will continue to work as expected.

</Admonition>

After completing the above steps, please follow the steps [here](/cocos2d-x/getting-started-ios#adding-ios) to integrate the xcframework version of Helpshift SDK.
