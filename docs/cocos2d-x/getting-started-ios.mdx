# Getting Started <small>iOS</small> {#getting-started}

<Intro>

Cocos2d-x plugin for Helpshift SDK helps you utilize Helpshift from your game's C++ codebase.

</Intro>

## Requirements {#version-requirements}

- Xcode 12.0 and above.
- Supported iOS versions:
  - iOS 15, 14, 13, 12, 11 and 10

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

With version 5.0.0 (SDK version 7.5.3), Helpshift SDK has dropped support for iOS 9. If you wish to keep supporting iOS 9 devices for your apps, please read the [KB Article](https://support.helpshift.com/kb/article/what-are-the-minimum-ios-versions-supported-by-helpshift/) to support Helpshift on older OS versions.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

If you have a project with Xcode version prior to Xcode 9, you could use the build mentioned [here](https://support.helpshift.com/kb/article/can-i-install-an-older-version-of-the-helpshift-sdk#plugins).

## Adding the Helpshift iOS plugin {#adding-ios}

- Unzip the package, add the contents of the `ios/Classes` folder into your Xcode project.
- From `ios/sdk` folder drag & drop `Helpshift.xcframework` into the Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded content in the General section of your Xcode project.
- If your app does not contain any swift code, set `Always Embed Swift Standard Libaries` under `Build Settings` to YES.
- In the Build Settings of your Xcode project, add `-fmodules` and `-fcxx-modules` flags under the `Other C Flags` section in both Debug and Release. Be careful while adding these flags in Debug and Release, because if you override the default flags you might face build errors. The `Other C Flags` section would look this after adding mentioned flags:

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

If you want to compile your Xcode project with bitcode enabled, please use Helpshift.framework present under 'ios/sdk/Bitcode' folder.

</Admonition>

- With version 5.3.0, End-users will be able to send files such as pdf, video, etc. where before 5.3.0 end-users could only send images. For iOS 10 and below, to access files in the “Files” app of iOS, developers will need to add iCloud capability with iCloud Documents services enabled. For more info please refer the [Prerequisites section here.](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/DocumentPickerProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014451)

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

#### Add NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription key in your application info plist file

If your app does not use this permission, you would need to add this key as well as description for the same. Not adding this key-description pair might cause app rejection.

**Description text:** “We need to access photos library to allow users manually pick images meant to be sent as attachment for help and support reasons.”

Note that this is just a suggested description. If you need localisations for the same, please <a href="https://support.helpshift.com/kb/contact/" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Please replace all the old files with new files.

## Initializing Helpshift in your App {#initializing}

Helpshift SDK uniquely identifies your App with the combination of:

<div className="text-sm compact ">

|             |                                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Key     | Your unique developer API Key.                              |
| Domain Name | Your Helpshift domain name. For example : foo.helpshift.com |
| App ID      | A unique ID assigned to your app.                           |

</div>

To get the `API Key`, `Domain Name` and the `App ID`, navigate to `Settings`>`SDK (for Developers)` in your agent dashboard and scroll down to **"Initializing Helpshift"** section. <Image src="/static/books/common/settings-integration.png"  width="full" />

Select your App from the dropdown and copy the three tokens to be passed when initializing Helpshift.

Initialize Helpshift by including `HelpshiftCocos2dx.h` and
calling `HelpshiftCocos2dx::install` in the `AppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()` function of your `AppDelegate.cpp`:

```cpp

    #include "HelpshiftCocos2dx.h"
    ...

    bool AppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching() {

        HelpshiftCocos2dx::install("<YOUR_API_KEY>",
                                   "<YOUR_HELPSHIFT_DOMAIN>.helpshift.com",
                                   "<YOUR_APP_ID>");
        ...

    }

```

## Start using Helpshift {#start-using}

Helpshift is now integrated in your app. You should now use the support APIs to [present FAQ](/cocos2d-x/support-tools-ios#faqs-view) or [conversation screens](/cocos2d-x/support-tools-ios#conversation-view) inside your app.

Run your app, and try starting a test conversation using the `showConversation` API call.
Then goto your Helpshift agent dashboard and reply to experience the in-app messaging.

Sample usage for FAQs and conversation APIs:

```cpp

    // Presenting FAQs to your customers
    void GameSettingsScene::menuHelpCallback(CCObject* pSender)
    {
        HelpshiftCocos2dx::showFAQs();
    }

    // Starting a conversation with your customers
    void GameSettingsScene::menuConversationCallback(CCObject* pSender)
    {
        HelpshiftCocos2dx::showConversation();
    }

```
