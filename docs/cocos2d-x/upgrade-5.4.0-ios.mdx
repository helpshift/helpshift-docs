## Framework packaging for SDK {#framework-packaging}

With version 5.4.0, Helpshift SDK is packaged as a dynamic framework rather than a static library. Please follow the steps mentioned here if you are migrating from an older version of Helpshift SDK.

### Manual Integration

- Remove all Helpshift SDK related files from the project, which are added from `ios/sdk` folder present in Helpshift Cocos2d-x package.
- Remove all wrapper files for Helpshift SDK from the project, which are added from `ios/Classes` folder present in Helpshift Cocos2d-x package.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

No changes are needed for custom theming plists and custom localization bundle when migrating. The old theming files and localization bundle will continue to work as expected.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

In case you have made changes to HelpshiftConfig.plist or HelpshiftConfigDark.plist, please rename the files to HelpshiftCustomConfig.plist and HelpshiftCustomConfigDark.plist respectively.

</Admonition>

- Remove `/usr/lib/swift` from runpath search paths in the build settings, if other SDKs in your app don’t need it.
- Remove `$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift-5.0/$(PLATFORM_NAME)` and `$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift/$(PLATFORM_NAME)` from `Library Search Paths` in the build settings, if other SDKs in your app don’t need it.
- Remove `-ObjC` flag from 'Other linker flags' section in the build settings, if other SDKs in your app don’t need it.
  After doing these, please follow the steps [here](/cocos2d-x/getting-started-ios#adding-ios) to integrate the framework version of the SDK.

#### Objective C Code

- If you have added any instances of `#import ”HelpshiftSupport.h”` and `#import ”HelpshiftCore.h”` please replace it with `@import Helpshift;`

#### Swift Code

- Remove all Helpshift related `#import` directives from your app’s Bridging header
- Add the `import Helpshift` directive in Swift files using Helpshift APIs
