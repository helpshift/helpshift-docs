<Intro>

Localizing & Internationalizing your in-app Support.


</Intro>


## Internationalization {#i18n}

Helpshift iOS SDK comes with support for **47** languages out of the box with English as the default. To enable the available languages, simply drag & drop the HsLocalization.bundle to your project.
The Helpshift SDK will be localized based on the user’s device language. This can be set by going to General → Language & Region → iPhone Language. If the user’s device language is not available, English will be used as default.

If the end-user has a language already set for their device (via
Settings->General->International->Language) the correct language
translations will be used. If the said language is not available English
will be used as default.


<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

#### Add only required languages from HSLocalization

If you are adding strings for a certain language, it enables that language in your app when submitted to the App store.
This has app wide implications and may cause unwanted problems if not taken care of.
Specifically, this can lead the App Store to detect that you support a particular language even
though you have not specifically added that language to your application.
Make sure to only add those languages that your app supports.

### Adding your own translations {#custom-translations}

Steps to add your own language translation to Helpshift iOS SDK:

1. Select your Project from XCode, you can see the Localizations section
  as shown below, click on the + symbol to add your Localization. Select
  the localization you want to add for e.g., Dutch.

2. Once you have selected Dutch, XCode will prompt you to choose
   reference language to create Dutch localization, select
   HelpshiftLocalizable.strings and select `English` as reference
   language, uncheck all other resource files in your project to create
   `Dutch` localization for Helpshift iOS SDK. See below for reference.

3. After you have pressed the Finish button, Xcode will create the file
   `HSLocalization/nl.lproj/HelpshiftLocalizable.strings`. Click
   "HelpshiftLocalizable.strings (Dutch)" from XCode to add Dutch
   Localization. See below for reference:

## Localization setup {#localization}


<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

For v3.2.0 and above

</Admonition>


The Helpshift localized strings (.lproj folders) have now
been moved from `HSResources` to `HSLocalization` folder in the Helpshift
zip file.The `HSLocalization` folder needs to be added to your project for the
languages you want to support. Just remove the respective .lproj folders
from `HSLocalization` for languages you do not wish to support.

If you're using SDK `v3.1.x` or below, and you're upgrading to SDK
`v3.2.0`, make sure to remove `HSResources` for `v3.1.x` from your project,
add `HSResources` and `HSLocalization` separately (as mentioned above) from
the SDK `v3.2.0` folder.

For Cocoapods, localized strings are not added by default on `pod install`. You must add the languages of your choice manually from
the `HSLocalization` folder. Drag and drop the corresponding .lproj folders into your project from the directory where Cocoapods saves the Helpshift SDK folder.

## Set SDK language {#set-language}


<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Applicable to SDK v1.7.0 and above.

</Admonition>


You can set the SDK language for the given locale using the method `setLanguage`.

Locale can contain two-letter lowercase ISO language codes (such as "en") as defined by ISO 639-1 and in addition contain two-letter uppercase ISO country codes (such as "US") as defined by ISO 3166-1. Language code and country code are separated by an underscore ("\_").

Example - "pt\_BR", "zh\_CN".

**For example:**

Setting language for the given locale with only language code.

```
HelpshiftCocos2dx::setLanguage("fr");
```

Setting the language for the given locale with both language code and country code.

```
HelpshiftCocos2dx::setLanguage("zh_CN");
```

Before you set the language, make sure that there exists translations for the Helpshift strings in that locale. List of supported locale is mentioned above. If there is a locale which we currently do not support out of the box, please add the relevant translation files in your app.

Now, **head over to [String Customization](/ios/string-customization)** for the list of strings that you can customize as per your needs.



<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

**KNOWN ISSUE - In-built strings don't show up in the Helpshift iOS SDK**

It happens if sometimes you did not enable localized strings for the `HelpshiftLocalizable.strings` file.
The Helpshift SDK reads all its strings from that strings file.
In Xcode on the left hand sidein "Project Navigator" select `HelpshiftLocalizable.strings`.
On the right in "Show Utilities" select "Show the File Inspector".
You will see a "Localize..." button. Click on that to enable localized
strings for the `.strings` file.
