# Helpshift APIs <small>iOS</small> {#support-tools}

<Intro>

Helpshift provides a way to use each functional element of the SDK separately based on your requirements.
You can call only specific screens from the SDK based on the
functionality you want to expose in your app.

There are 4 different ways in which the Helpshift SDK can be presented in your app.

</Intro>

## Integrating Contact Us & In App Messaging {#conversation-view}

```cpp
    HelpshiftCocos2dx::showConversation();
```

You can use the `showConversation` API to provide a way for the user to
send feedback or start a new conversation with you.This has been
provided if you want to embed a **"Send Feedback"** or **"Contact Us"**
action in your app and want to lead the user to this action directly
without having to go to the FAQ. Once, a user starts a new conversation,
this API call will show the conversation activity. The conversation will
ensue until it is resolved (and the resolution is accepted by the user) or rejected by the agent.

## Integrating FAQs {#faqs-view}

```cpp
    HelpshiftCocos2dx::showFAQs();
```

You can use the `showFAQs` API call to provide a way for the user to invoke the purpose built help/support section in your app. This is the easiest approach to enable help in your app as it bundles all the capabilities of the Helpshift SDK in a simple and intuitive interface.
_You can wire this API call to a **"Help"** or **"Support"** action in your app._ This Activity combines the FAQ, Search and Contact Us functionality together in a single interface. In this view a user has to search for a specific question in the FAQ failing which they can report an issue. When you respond back to their question from the Helpshift Agent Dashboard, the reply will be shown as a count besides Contact Us, clicking on which will open up the conversation.

Check out [API Options](/cocos2d-x/sdk-configuration-ios/) for more configuration.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

English translation will be used for non-localized FAQs. To use deep linking in your app using Helpshift FAQs, check [here](/ios/deep-linking/).

## Showing a Particular FAQ Section {#faq-section-view}

<Centered width="half">

<Image src="/static/books/ios/single-section.png" width="quarter" />

</Centered>

```cpp
    HelpshiftCocos2dx::showFAQSection("11");
```

You can use the `showFAQSection` API call to show faqs from a particular FAQ section.

**You'll need the `publish-id` of the section in this case:**

<Image src="/static/books/misc/section-publish-id.png" width="full" />

This feature works like a permalink for displaying specific FAQ sections as context sensitive help in your app. For example, if your app requires the user to login to using email, Facebook and Twitter, you could wire a help action on the login screen that can link to the Helpshift FAQ section called "Login help" which has several questions related to login methods.

Check out [API Options](/cocos2d-x/sdk-configuration-ios/) for more configuration.

## Showing a Particular FAQ Question {#faq-question-view}

<Centered width="half">

<Image src="/static/books/ios/single-faq.png" width="quarter" />

</Centered>

```cpp
    HelpshiftCocos2dx::showSingleFAQ("51");
```

You can use the `showSingleFAQ` API call to show a single faq question.

**You'll need the `publish-id` of the FAQ in this case:**

<Image src="/static/books/misc/faq-publish-id.png" width="full" />

## FAQ Filtering by tags {#faq-filtering}

Starting v1.0.0 onwards, we have introduced FAQ filtering capability by tags. With the goal of helping the end user see focused & related content e.g. basis the user demographic or device profiles, developers can now choose the new capability for FAQ filtering and showing a focused FAQ list to the right audience.
Typical cases why you would want to use FAQ filtering are :

- You want to show specific FAQs for specific audience. E.g. if you may categorize the users as ‘beginner’, ‘intermediate’ or ‘expert’ based on your business logic
- You may want to show specific FAQs based on the device. E.g. a set of FAQs for Tablet vs. Phone

FAQ filtering is a 2 step approach

1. FAQs need to be classified using the issue tags field on the dashboard e.g. tags ‘phone’ & ‘tablet’.
   <Image src="/static/books/android/faq-filtering.png" width="full" />
2. Once the FAQs are tagged, they can be filtered at the SDK using the filter options described here.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Helpshift has 2 types of tags mainly `Issue Tags` & `Search Tags`.

- Issue tags are used to filter the FAQ list on the SDK with the filter rules.
- Search tags (a.k.a Search Keywords) When performing in-app search, Helpshift SDK gives preference to these keywords. You can also use this to add alternative keywords that users might search for, but which may not exist in the FAQ title or the content.

</Admonition>

### How to use FAQ filtering

This will be a config option which will be supported by the showFAQs and showFAQSection APIs.

**For example:**

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="For Cocos2d-x 3.x " label="For Cocos2d-x 3.x ">

```cpp
    ValueVector tags;
    tags.push_back(Value(""));
    tags.push_back(Value("Testing1"));
    tags.push_back(Value("Cocos2dx"));

    meta[HS_TAGS_KEY] = tags;
    config[HS_META_DATA_KEY] = meta;
    config[HS_GOTO_CONVERSATION_AFTER_CONTACT_US] = gotoConversationAfterContactUs;
    config[HS_ENABLE_CONTACT_US] = enableContactUs;
    config[HS_REQUIRE_EMAIL] = requireEmail;
    ValueMap filter;
    filter["operator"] = "or";
    filter["tags"] = tags;
    config[HS_WITH_TAGS_MATCHING] = filter;

    HelpshiftCocos2dx::showFAQs(config);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="For Cocos2d-x 2.x :" label="For Cocos2d-x 2.x :">

```cpp
    cocos2d::CCArray *tags = new cocos2d::CCArray();
    tags->addObject(new CCString("Testing1"));
    tags->addObject(new CCString("Cocos2dx"));

    cocos2d::CCDictionary *faqMap = new cocos2d::CCDictionary();
    faqMap->setObject(tags,"tags");
    faqMap->setObject(new CCString("or"), "operator");
    config->setObject(faqMap, HS_WITH_TAGS_MATCHING);

    HelpshiftCocos2dx::showFAQs(config);
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The `withTagsMatching` option will be a HashMap containing 2 keys

- operator : one of “and”, “or”, “not” which will serve as conditional operators for the given tags (String).
- tags : the actual tags in the query (String Array)

## Guided Issue Filing {#dynamic-forms}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Applicable to version 1.0.0 and above & Nested Dynamic form is
applicable to version v1.1.0-support and above

</Admonition>

Guided issue filing is a feature to capture more context when a user interacts with Helpshift Support. For example, lets say you want the user to file a ticket in case of a complaint and also in case he want to suggest a feature. With dynamic forms, you will now be able to distinguish between these two use cases and take required actions (like assigning appropriate agents).

Dynamic forms also enable better FAQ discovery. Lets say there is a frequently viewed FAQ or FAQ section buried deep in your FAQ hierarchy. Some users might miss it out and opt to file an issue instead. With dynamic forms, you can create a new section (like top FAQs) that links to that FAQ section. Or create and alternate title to an FAQ (like 'How do I pay for gems' instead of 'Billing').

The app configures a dynamic form using 'flows' which are dictionaries with the appropriate keys present. There are 5 types of flows:

1. Flow to show conversation screen

   - `HS_CONVERSATION_FLOW`
   - similar to the HelpshiftCocos2dx::showConversation API

2. Flow to show all FAQs

   - `HS_FAQS_FLOW`
   - similar to the HelpshiftCocos2dx::showFAQs API

3. Flow to show a FAQ section

   - `HS_FAQ_SECTION_FLOW`
   - similar to the HelpshiftCocos2dx::showFAQSection API

4. Flow to show a single FAQ

   - `HS_SINGLE_FAQ_FLOW`
   - similar to the HelpshiftCocos2dx::showSingleFAQ API

5. Flow to show a nested Dynamic form

   - `HS_DYNAMIC_FORM_FLOW`

Each flow need a display text. This will be the text that will be displayed in the row. Some flows also expect a `HS_FLOW_CONFIG` dict. This will be the config that is passed to the subsequent Support API.

To show the dynamic form, use the `HelpshiftCocos2dx::showDynamicForm` API

**For example:**

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="For Cocos2d-x 3.x " label="For Cocos2d-x 3.x ">

```cpp
    ValueVector forms;
    ValueMap conversationMap;
    conversationMap[HS_FLOW_TYPE] = HS_CONVERSATION_FLOW;
    conversationMap[HS_FLOW_TITLE] = Value("Conversations");
    forms.push_back(Value(conversationMap));

    ValueMap sectionMap;
    sectionMap[HS_FLOW_TYPE] = HS_FAQ_SECTION_FLOW;
    sectionMap[HS_FLOW_TITLE] = Value("Section");
    sectionMap[HS_FLOW_DATA] = Value("9");
    forms.push_back(Value(sectionMap));

    ValueMap questionMap;
    questionMap[HS_FLOW_TYPE] = HS_SINGLE_FAQ_FLOW;
    questionMap[HS_FLOW_TITLE] = Value("Question");
    questionMap[HS_FLOW_DATA] = Value("95");
    forms.push_back(Value(questionMap));

    ValueMap faqMap;
    faqMap[HS_FLOW_TYPE] = HS_FAQS_FLOW;
    faqMap[HS_FLOW_TITLE] = Value("FAQ");
    forms.push_back(Value(faqMap));

    ValueMap nestedMap;
    nestedMap[HS_FLOW_TYPE] = HS_DYNAMIC_FORM_FLOW;
    nestedMap[HS_FLOW_TITLE] = Value("Nested form");
    nestedMap[HS_FLOW_DATA] = Value(forms);
    forms.push_back(Value(nestedMap));

    #if (CC_TARGET_PLATFORM == CC_PLATFORM_IOS)
    HelpshiftCocos2dx::showDynamicForm("Dynamic it is !", forms);
    #else
    HelpshiftCocos2dx::showDynamicForm(forms);
    #endif
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="For Cocos2d-x 2.x :" label="For Cocos2d-x 2.x :">

```cpp
    cocos2d::CCArray *forms = CCArray::create();
    cocos2d::CCDictionary *conversationForm = CCDictionary::create();
    conversationForm->setObject(new CCString(HS_CONVERSATION_FLOW), HS_FLOW_TYPE);
    conversationForm->setObject(new CCString("Conversation"), HS_FLOW_TITLE);
    forms->addObject(conversationForm);

    cocos2d::CCDictionary *singleFAQForm = CCDictionary::create();
    singleFAQForm->setObject(new CCString(HS_FAQ_SECTION_FLOW), HS_FLOW_TYPE);
    singleFAQForm->setObject(new CCString("Single FAQ"), HS_FLOW_TITLE);
    singleFAQForm->setObject(new CCString("9"), HS_FLOW_DATA);
    forms->addObject(singleFAQForm);

    cocos2d::CCArray *formsN = CCArray::create();
    cocos2d::CCDictionary *conversationFormN = CCDictionary::create();
    conversationFormN->setObject(new CCString(HS_CONVERSATION_FLOW), HS_FLOW_TYPE);
    conversationFormN->setObject(new CCString("Conversation"), HS_FLOW_TITLE);
    formsN->addObject(conversationFormN);

    cocos2d::CCDictionary *singleFAQFormN = CCDictionary::create();
    singleFAQFormN->setObject(new CCString(HS_FAQ_SECTION_FLOW), HS_FLOW_TYPE);
    singleFAQFormN->setObject(new CCString("Single FAQ"), HS_FLOW_TITLE);
    singleFAQFormN->setObject(new CCString("9"), HS_FLOW_DATA);
    formsN->addObject(singleFAQFormN);

    cocos2d::CCDictionary *nestedForm = CCDictionary::create();
    nestedForm->setObject(new CCString(HS_DYNAMIC_FORM_FLOW), HS_FLOW_TYPE);
    nestedForm->setObject(new CCString("Nested Form"), HS_FLOW_TITLE);
    nestedForm->setObject(formsN, HS_FLOW_DATA);
    forms->addObject(nestedForm);

    #if (CC_TARGET_PLATFORM == CC_PLATFORM_IOS)
    HelpshiftCocos2dx::showDynamicForm("Dynamic it is !", forms);
    #else
    HelpshiftCocos2dx::showDynamicForm(forms);
    #endif
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Each dynamic form needs :

1. **Title**: This will be the title displayed on the action bar
2. **flows**: An List of dictionary objects as discussed above.

Check out [API Options](/cocos2d-x/sdk-configuration-ios/) for more configuration.

## Close Helpshift Session {#closeHelpshiftSupportSession}

This API can be used to close an active Helpshift session and return to the app. Any open Helpshift screen will be dismissed and control will return to the original UIViewController that launched the Helpshift screen. The completion handler will be called after the Helpshift session is closed. If the session is already closed, the completion handler will be called immediately. This API can be useful in situations where the app wants to open its own UI screen in response to a deep link but the Helpshift session is still open.

Sample usage for close Helpshiftg Support session API:

```cpp
    void helpshiftSupportSessionCompletionHandler() {
        // your code here
    }
    .
    .
    .
    HelpshiftCocos2dx::closeHelpshiftSupportSessionWithCompletionHandler(helpshiftSupportSessionCompletionHandler);
```

## Enable Testing Mode {#enable-testing-mode}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Applicable to v5.0.0 and above

</Admonition>

The Helpshift SDK provides an API to allow developers set the testing mode for the SDK. This API is called `enableTestingMode`. It signals that the SDK is running in testing mode, and allows the SDK to modify certain behaviors to enable better testing. These changes in behavior will be called out in the respective API/Feature documentation. There are certain restrictions that developers should consider prior to using this API:

- The API must be called even before the install call of the SDK.
- The API must be called in the debug build of the app only. Developers can ensure that it is not called in release build by wrapping the call to this API inside `#ifdef DEBUG`.

Example :

```cpp
    #ifdef DEBUG
        HelpshiftCocos2dx::enableTestingMode();
    #endif
```
