## Support for Swift {#support-for-swift}

With version 5.3.0, Helpshift SDK has added support for Swift. In order to use SDK 5.3.x for your app, Helpshift recommends you to follow the steps, depending on whether your app is made in Swift, ObjectiveC or mix of both. The minimum required XCode version is 10.2. If you have questions or feedback, please <a href="https://support.helpshift.com/kb/contact/" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>

## Granting iCloud permission for iOS 10 and below {#icloud-capability}

With version 5.3.0, End-users will be able to send files such as pdf, video, etc. where before 5.3.0 end-users could only send images. For iOS 10 and below, to access files in the “Files” app of iOS, developers will need to add iCloud capability with iCloud Documents services enabled.
