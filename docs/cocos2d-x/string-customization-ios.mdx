# String Customization {#string-customization}

<Intro>

Customize all the strings in Helpshift SDK's user interface

</Intro>

Starting from version 1.3.0, Helpshift now uses the HSLocalization bundle to read the default values of all the string translations.

You can customize all the strings used in the Helpshift SDK by following the below steps.

1. Create a `HelpshiftCustomLocalization` bundle file and add it into your Application.
   The access path for this bundle will be : `path-to-main-bundle/HelpshiftCustomLocalization.bundle`.
1. Copy the lproj files which you are interested in supporting from the HelpshiftCustomLocalizations folder which ships with the Helpshift SDK zip file.
1. Add the lproj files selected in the previous step and add those to the HelpshiftCustomLocalization bundle.
1. Change translations of the relevant keys in the HelpshiftLocalizable.strings files.

Below is the description of the keys (in the
`HelpshiftLocalizable.strings` file) for each of the customizable strings
in the app:
