# Release Notes

<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

With the transition to TLSv1.2 on Sep 20,2021, connections to a Helpshift SDK via any previous TLS version will not work as expected. Specifically, this means that:

- Helpshift SDKs will not work or load on lower-end Android devices (meaning, Android 4.x and earlier), because these lower-end Android versions do not support TLSv1.2.
- End-users on lower-end Android devices will not be able to access FAQs, raise new issues, or access their past support conversations.
- On a lower-end Android device, the mobile app that embeds a Helpshift SDK will be prevented from communicating with the SDK for any purpose. However, this disconnect will not cause any malfunction or crash on the parent application.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

- If you have released your Android app with `5.5.0` version, we highly recommend that you upgrade to `5.5.1` which fixes an important bug. Refer [here](/cocos2d-x/release-notes-android#v551).
