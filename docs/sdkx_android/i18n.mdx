<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

All the public APIs in the SDK should be called after initializing the SDK via [Helpshift.install() API](/sdkx_android/getting-started#start-using)

</Admonition>

Helpshift SDK X currently supports 50 languages out-of-the-box (with English as the default).

## Supported languages {#supported-languages}

<SupportedLanguages />

## Setting a Language {#language-change-programatically}

<SetLanguageDescription />

For example :

Setting SDK language for the given locale with only language code.

```java
Helpshift.setLanguage("fr");
```

![](/static/books/sdkx_android/i18n.png)

Setting the SDK language for the given locale with both language code and country code.

```java
Helpshift.setLanguage("zh-SG");
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

- The default language is set to English (`en`) i.e. if you don't set any language using the `setLanguage()` API, SDK will use English language.
- All language codes are case-sensitive.
