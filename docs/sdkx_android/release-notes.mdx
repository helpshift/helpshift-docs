# Release Notes


<LatestSdkVersion>

## 10.5.0

_December 3rd, 2025_

** Release Notes **

- Introduced Proactive Engagement feature which lets you reach out to your players by sending Push/In app Notifications on their mobile devices and engage in various ways including starting conversations. For more details please refer:  TODO KB article link for proactive engagement
  - For integration details please refer [Proactive Engagement](/sdkx_android/proactive-engagement)
  - Please note that the SDK does not ask for posting notifications permission for client application. For Proactive Engagement, you need to ask for the [POST_NOTIFICATION](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/notification-permission ) permission yourself.
- SDK now compiles with API level 36, i.e compileSdk 36.
- Added new API to pause in-app notifications. This will pause/unpause in-app notifications for Proactive Engagement notifications. Please refer [shouldPauseInAppNotification](link to the api doc) here for details
- No issues observed in the SDK in supporting Android 16 latest updates.
- End of technical support for bugs reported on Android 7 and below, although SDK will be compatible and no functionality is affected.
- Added support to provide [unread message count delegate](/sdkx_android/delegates/#unread-message-count) callback when a message is received even via push notifications or internal polling. This would help in better tracking of unread messages by the client application.
  - Previously this callback was only invoked in response to client app call for [requestUnreadMessageCount(boolean shouldFetchFromServer)](https://developers.helpshift.com/sdkx_android/notifications/#showing-notification-count ) API.
- Remove usage of deprecated Android APIs being used in the SDK.
  - Activity.getWindow().setStatusBarColor() is deprecated but needs to be used below Android 15, hence it has been kept unchanged internally.
- We have started adopting some Java 8 features in the SDK. If you run into any Java 8 related build or runtime failures then please refer to [this guide from Android](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support)
  - We currently use Lambda Expressions only.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed a bug where Helpcenter screen was detecting application foreground events incorrectly.
- Fixed an intermittent bug where application was crashing due to Webview not being available on the device. The SDK will now ignore the cases where Webview is not available and will be in no-op mode.

_August 15th, 2025_

- Android 16 is supported without any changes required in the SDK.

_November 27th, 2024_

  - For more details on user identities, refer [User Identities](/sdkx_android/identity-user-hub/) page.
  - For more details on user data collection, refer [Tracking](/sdkx_android/tracking/#update-global-user-data) page.
- Fixed an edge case bug where message count was incorrect when login and unread message count APIs were invoked in quick succession.
- Error logs from SDK will always get logged on logcat.
- Debug build for debug logs is not required any more, only `enableLogging` flag needs to be set to `true`.

## 10.3.0

_October 31st, 2023_

** Release Notes **

- SDK X now supports only Android 7, i.e API Level 24, and above. SDK will be non-operational when your app is installed on a device below Android 7 Nougat.

- Added support for sending multiple attachments in conversations (Support for multiple attachment in bot upload step will be added in Q1`24).

This change is in existing API to introduce mandatory validations for login parameters and hence this might affect existing code compilation.
