# Tracking {#tracking}

<Intro>

Track events and user actions when the user starts a new conversation.
Attach custom metadata to every conversation started via the SDK.

</Intro>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

All the public APIs in the SDK should be called after initializing the SDK via [Helpshift.install() API](/sdkx_android/getting-started#start-using)

</Admonition>

## Adding Tags to Conversations {#adding-tags}

You can attach tags while reporting an issue by passing them to the `configMap` object at the time of calling `Helpshift.showConversation(this, configMap)`. You can pass an **array of strings** with a key `"tags"` which will get added as Tags when the issue is created.

For example:

```java
    Map<String, Object> config = new HashMap<>();
    config.put("tags", new String[]{"foo", "bar"});

    Helpshift.showConversation(MainActivity.this, config);


```

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

**On tag names & compatibility**

- Tags must be pre-created in the Helpshift Dashboard (Settings → Tags), otherwise they will be ignored.
- The attached tags must exactly match the tags present on the dashboard.

</Admonition>

## Adding Custom Metadata to Conversations

You can attach additional metadata to every new conversation started by the app user. This metadata can include properties like username, email, game scores, current game levels, and any other data needed to provide relevant context for each new conversation. You can attach custom metadata by passing it to the `configMap` object at the time of calling any of the SDK X APIs (`showConversation`, `showFAQs`, `showSingleFAQ`, `showFAQSection`) like `Helpshift.showConversation(this, configMap)`.

Use code:

```java

HashMap<String, String> customMetadata = new HashMap<String, String();
customMetadata.put("usertype","paid");
customMetadata.put("level","7");
customMetadata.put("score","12345");

HashMap<String, Object> config = new HashMap<>();
config.put("customMetadata", customMetadata);

Helpshift.showConversation(MainActivity.this, config);
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Metadata should only be sent as String key-value pairs.

</Admonition>

## Set Custom Issue Fields {#set-custom-issue-fields}

If you want to set Custom Issue Fields at the time of Issue creation, follow the steps.

1. Initialise a top level custom issue fields' `Map`
2. Define your custom issue field `Map`
3. Add the `"type"` and `"value"` for that custom issue field
4. Add the custom issue field map to top level map (with key as your configured key and value as custom issue field map)
5. Pass the map to `configMap` with key `"customIssueFields"` of the `Helpshift.showConversation(this, configMap)`

```java

    Map<String, Object> joiningDate = new HashMap<>();
    joiningDate.put("type", "date");
    joiningDate.put("value", 1505927361535L);

    Map<String, String> stockLevel = new HashMap<>();
    stockLevel.put("type", "number");
    stockLevel.put("value", "1505");

    Map<String, String> employeeName= new HashMap<>();
    employeeName.put("type", "singleline");
    employeeName.put("value", "Bugs helpshift");

    Map<String, String> isPro = new HashMap<>();
    isPro.put("type", "boolean");
    isPro.put("value", "true");

    Map<String, Object> cifMap = new HashMap<>();
    cifMap.put("joining_date", joiningDate);
    cifMap.put("stock_level", stockLevel);
    cifMap.put("employee_name", employeeName);
    cifMap.put("is_pro", isPro);


    Map<String, Object> config = new HashMap<>();
    // other configs...
    //..
    config.put("customIssueFields", cifMap);

    Helpshift.showConversation(MainActivity.this, config);


```

The following are the valid values for the `type` key of a Custom Issue Field.

- "singleline"
- "multiline"
- "number"
- "checkbox"
- "dropdown"
- "date"

Compatibility table for type and values:

| Type       | Value   | Comments                                                        |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| singleline | string  | Character limit of 255                                          |
| multiline  | string  | Character limit of 100,000                                      |
| number     | string  |                                                                 |
| dropdown   | string  | Drop-down options should exist for the given Custom Issue Field |
| date       | number  | Epoch time. For example - **Date.now()**                        |
| checkbox   | boolean |                                                                 |

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

In the **Breadcrumbs** and **Debug logs** APIs, passing of formatted strings is NOT supported. It is recommended to pass data only in a simple String format.

<p className="m-0">For example:</p>

* "{\"key\":\"value\"}" - ** JSON String, This is NOT supported **
* "key - value" - ** Simple string, This is supported **

</Admonition>

## Breadcrumbs {#breadcrumbs}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

** Applicable to SDK X v10.1.0 & above **

</Admonition>

Breadcrumbs can be used to track events or end-user actions. It helps you to add debugging information regarding end-user actions, which will be passed along with every new conversation on Helpshift’s Agent Dashboard. To leave breadcrumbs, use `leaveBreadCrumb` API —

For example:

```java

    Helpshift.leaveBreadCrumb("Any breadcrumb string");

```

Breadcrumbs are collected within the set breadcrumb limit. The limit is set under the SDK Configurations section for App Settings in the Helpshift’s Agent Dashboard. Breadcrumbs are collected in a FIFO queue. If you want to clear the breadcrumbs, use the `clearBreadCrumbs` API —

For example:

```java

    Helpshift.clearBreadCrumbs();

```

## Debug Logs {#debug-logs}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

** Applicable to SDK X v10.1.0 & above **

</Admonition>

You may wish to pass additional debug logs with every new conversation filed by an end-user on Helpshift’s Agent Dashboard. This can be achieved by using `com.helpshift.HSDebugLog`.

For example:

```java

    HSDebugLog.d("TAG", "Any Debug log string");

```

Debug logs are collected within the set debug logs limit. The limit is set under the SDK Configurations section for App Settings in the Helpshift’s Agent Dashboard. Debug logs are collected in a FIFO queue.
