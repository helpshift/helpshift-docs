# Helpshift APIs {#support-tools}

<Intro>

Helpshift provides a way to use functional element of the SDK based on your requirements.

</Intro>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

All the public APIs in the SDK should be called after initializing the SDK via [Helpshift.install() API](/sdkx_android/getting-started#start-using)

</Admonition>

## Integrating Contact Us & In App Messaging {#conversation-view}

You can call `Helpshift.showConversation(MyActivity.this, configurationMap)` to allow a user to directly send feedback or start a new conversation without having to first view FAQs. Once user starts a new conversation, this API call will show the conversation screen. The conversation will continue until it is resolved or rejected by the agent.

</Centered>

Example:

```java
	// config map
	Map<String, Object> config = new HashMap<>();

    // set tags for tracking
    config.put("tags", new String[]{"foo", "bar"});

    // set custom issue fields
    Map<String, Object> cifMap = new HashMap<>();
    Map<String, String> isPro = new HashMap<>();
    isPro.put("type", "boolean");
    isPro.put("value", "true");
    cifMap.put("is_pro", isPro);

    config.put("cifs", cifMap);

    //..etc

    // pass the config map in the api
    Helpshift.showConversation(MainActivity.this, config);
```

<CustomIssueFieldsKeyDeprecationNotice />

`Helpshift.showConversation(MyActivity.this, configMap);` where `MyActivity.this` is the Activity you're calling Helpshift from and `configMap` is the configuration map that you want to pass to configure the SDK.

Supports these [API Options](/sdkx_android/sdk-configuration/).

## Integrating FAQs {#faqs-view}

You can use the API call `Helpshift.showFAQs(Activity a, Map<String, Object> configMap)` to provide a way for the user to invoke the purpose built help/support section in your app. This is the easiest approach to enable help in your app as it bundles all the capabilities of the Helpshift SDK in a simple and intuitive interface. You can wire this api call to a **"Help"** or **"Support"** action in your app.

<Centered >

![showFAQs.png](/static/books/sdkx_android/show_faqs.png "showFAQs.png")

</Centered>

This Activity combines the FAQ, Search and Contact Us functionality together in a single interface. In this view, a user can search for a specific question in the FAQ failing which they can report an issue. When you respond back to their question from the Helpshift Agent Dashboard, the reply will be shown as a count besides Contact Us, clicking on which will open up the conversation.

Example:
`Helpshift.showFAQs(MyActivity.this, configMap);` where `MyActivity.this` is the Activity you're calling Helpshift from and `configMap` is the configuration map that you want to pass to configure the SDK.

Supports these [API Options](/sdkx_android/sdk-configuration/).

## Showing a Particular FAQ Section {#faq-section-view}

You can use the API call
`Helpshift.showFAQSection(Activity a, String sectionPublishId,  Map<String, Object> configMap)` to show FAQs from a particular FAQ section.

<Centered >

![showFAQSection.png](/static/books/sdkx_android/show_section.png "showFAQSection.png")

</Centered>

**You will need the `publish-id` of the FAQ section to use this API:**

<Image src="/static/books/misc/section-publish-id.png" width="full" />{" "}

This feature works like a permalink for displaying specific FAQ sections as context sensitive help in your app. For example, if your app requires the user to login to using email, facebook and twitter, you could wire a help action on the login screen that can link to the Helpshift FAQ section called "Login help" which has several questions related to login methods.

Example:
`Helpshift.showFAQSection(MyActivity.this, "11", configMap);` where `MyActivity.this` is the Activity you're calling Helpshift from and "11" is the FAQ section `publish-id`

Supports these [API Options](/sdkx_android/sdk-configuration/).

## Showing a Particular FAQ {#faq-question-view}

You can use the API call `Helpshift.showSingleFAQ(Activity a, String questionPublishId,  Map<String, Object> configMap)` to show a single FAQ.

<Centered >

![showSingleFAQ.png](/static/books/sdkx_android/show_single_faq.png "showSingleFAQ.png")

</Centered>

**You'll need the `publish-id` of the FAQ to use this API:**

<Image src="/static/books/misc/faq-publish-id.png" width="full" />{" "}

Example: `Helpshift.showSingleFAQ(MyActivity.this, "51", configMap);` where `MyActivity.this` is the Activity you're calling Helpshift from and "51" is the FAQ publish-id.

Supports these [API Options](/sdkx_android/sdk-configuration/).

## Set SDK language {#set-language-api}


For more info about this API and languages you can refer [here](/sdkx_android/i18n/).

## Getting SDK Version {#get-sdk-version}

You can use `getSDKVersion` API to get the current version of Helpshift SDK X.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

This API is available from 10.3.0 version

</Admonition>

```java
  // Returns SDK version as a string eg. "10.3.0"
  Helpshift.getSDKVersion();
```

## Clossing a Helpshift Session {#close-session}

You can use `Helpshift.closeSession` API to close an active SDK session. If no SDK session is active, calling this API will have no effect.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

This API is available from 10.3.0 version.

</Admonition>

```java
  // closes Helpshift sdk session
  Helpshift.closeSession();
```
