# Impact Analysis {#performance}

<Intro>

The following numbers are representative of a skeletal sample app
integrated with the Helpshift SDK.


</Intro>



## v10.2.0

### SDK payload in your app {#payload-size}

The Helpshift SDK X will add `212 Kb` to your application's release APK. 
This analysis was done with Android Gradle Plugin `v4.1.1` and Gradle `v6.5`.
The `212 Kb` size includes total impact with all the resources and code.

### Method count {#methods-count}

The Helpshift SDK X will add 1294 methods to your dex:

| Package                                                 | Method Count             |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------:|
| **com.helpshift**                                       |                  `1294`  |

### Memory usage {#memory-usage}
