All the public APIs in the SDK should be called after initializing the SDK via [Helpshift installWithPlatformId API](/sdkx_ios/getting-started#start-using)

Helpshift SDK currently supports 47 languages out-of-the-box (with English as the default).

## Setting a Language {#setting-a-language}

You can set the language by calling the [`setLanguage`](/sdkx_ios/support-tools#set-language) API to set the language after the initialization code.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

The preferred way to set the language is to use the `helpshiftConfig` object over the `setLanguage` API.

</Admonition>

Here's a screenshot of how SDK will look after setting the language to French.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

The default language is set to English (`en`) i.e. if you don't set any language using the `setLanguage:` api, SDK will use English as language.
