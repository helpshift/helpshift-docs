# Getting Started {#getting-started}

<Intro>

Follow these simple steps to add Helpshift in-app support to your
iOS app right away.

</Intro>

## Requirements {#version-requirements}

- Xcode 12.0 and above.
- Cocoapods v1.10.0
- Supported iOS versions:
  - iOS 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10

## Automated Integration using Cocoapods {#cocoapods}

To start using SDK X `v[% sdkx_ios.sdk_version  %]` in your project, add the following line to your `Podfile`

```ruby
pod 'HelpshiftX', '[% sdkx_ios.sdk_version  %]'
```

And run `pod install` or `pod update` to refresh your
[cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) dependencies.

You can now move on to [Initializing Helpshift in your App](#initializing).

## Automated Integration using Swift Package Manager {#spm}

To start using Helpshift `v[% sdkx_ios.sdk_version  %]` in your SPM project, add the following package URL to your project's "Package Dependencies" section

```text
https://github.com/helpshift/HelpshiftX
```

For version rules, we recommend using either "Exact" or "Up to Next Minor" and manually updating the version number when a major version of Helpshift SDK X is released.

You can now move on to [Initializing Helpshift in your App](#initializing).

## Manual Integration {#manual-integration}

### Get the latest SDK zip {#getting-sdk}

Download the latest for the Helpshift iOS SDK.

<DownloadButton
  text="Download SDK"
  link="[% sdkx_ios.sdk_url %]"
  classes="mb-4"
/>

The zip file contains

<div className="text-sm compact ">

#### Non-bitcode build of SDK X

Since bitcode has been deprecated starting Xcode 14, we have created a non-bitcode build based on the latest version of SDK X. This build can be downloaded from [here](https://d3e51fp79zp4el.cloudfront.net/sdkx/latest/ios/helpshiftx-sdk-ios-non-bitcode.zip).

</Admonition>


### Add the latest stable SDK release to your project {#add-to-project}

- Unzip the SDK and drag drop `HelpshiftX.xcframework` into your Xcode project
- In the `General` section of your app target, verify that the `HelpshiftX.xcframework` is present in the `Framework, Libraries, and Embedded Content` section
  with the option `Embed and Sign` selected from the Embed options dropdown.
  &nbsp;&nbsp; <Image src="/static/books/sdkx_ios/embed_and_sign_framework.png"  width="full" />
- After successful integration, `Build Phases` should look like this:

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

#### Add NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription key in your application info plist file

If your app does not use this permission, you would need to add this key as well as description for the same. Not adding this key-description pair might cause app rejection.

**NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription Description text:** "We need to access photos library to allow users manually pick images meant to be sent as attachment for help and support reasons."

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

The following instructions apply to versions below SDK X 10.2.0.

#### Along with NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription (as mentioned above), also add NSCameraUsageDescription and NSMicrophoneUsageDescription key in your application info plist file

If your app does not use this permission, you would need to add this key as well as description for the same. Not adding this key-description pair might cause app rejection.

**NSCameraUsageDescription Description text:** "We need to access the camera to allow users to click images meant to be sent as an attachment for help and support reasons."

**NSMicrophoneUsageDescription Description text:** "We need to access the microphone to allow users to record and send videos meant to be sent as an attachment for help and support reasons."

Note that this is just a suggested description. If you need localisations for the same, please <a href="https://support.helpshift.com/kb/contact/" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>

End-users can attach files such as pdf, video, etc in their issues. For iOS 10 and below, to access files in the “Files” app of iOS, developers will need to add iCloud capability with iCloud Documents services enabled. For more info please refer the [Prerequisites section here.](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/DocumentPickerProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014451)

## Start using Helpshift {#start-using}

Helpshift is now integrated in your app and ready to collect meaningful data about your users.

### Initializing Helpshift in your app {#initializing}

1. First, create an app on the Helpshift Dashboard

   <Image src="/static/books/helpshiftx/add_app.png" width="full" />{" "}

2. Create an app with **iOS** as a selected `Platform`
   <Image src="/static/books/sdkx_ios/select_platform.png" width="full" />{" "}

Helpshift uniquely identifies each registered App using a combination
of 2 tokens.

<div className=" compact">

|                          |                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Platform ID` | Your App's unique platform id (App's `App Id` on dashboard is your platform Id) |
| `Domain Name` | This is your Helpshift domain name e.g. _happyapps.helpshift.com_                            |

</div>

You can find these by navigating to `Settings`>`SDK (for Developers)` in your agent dashboard. Select your App and _check `iOS` as a platform_ from the dropdowns and copy the 2 tokens to be passed when initializing Helpshift.

<Image src="/static/books/sdkx_ios/copy_keys.png" width="full" />{" "}

Initialize SDK by calling `installWithPlatformId:` method.

 You can optionally pass to configuration dictionary to `installWithPlatformId:` API. To see supported configurations, check the [SDK Configuration](/sdkx_ios/sdk-configuration.mdx) page.

        return true
    }
...
```

<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

** Placing the install call **

You should not place the install call anywhere other than `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`
Placing it elsewhere might cause unexpected runtime problems.
Helpshift install call will throw `InstallException` in case the validation of the SDK keys fail.
