** Release Notes **

- Users can select and send more than one attachment in conversations.
- Added support for iOS 17 and iPadOS 17.
- Added a new API for fetching SDK X version. For more details, refer [here](/sdkx_ios/support-tools/#getting-the-sdk-version).
- Added a new API for closing the currently active SDK session. For more details, refer [here](/sdkx_ios/support-tools/#closing-an-open-sdk-session).
- Deprecated ViewController-based public APIs in favor of newer ViewController-less variants. For more details, refer [Helpshift APIs](/sdkx_ios/support-tools/).
