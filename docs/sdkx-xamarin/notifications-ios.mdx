## Configure push notifications via Helpshift {#push-via-helpshift}

Notifications can be sent to your users when you reply to an issue submitted by them. In addition to the expected Push Notification behavior on iOS, you can customize your notifications to display a numbered badge on your App icon or play a sound alert when a notification is received.

If your app does not already use push, you will need to enable push for your app. To enable push notification in your application you need to add APNS registration code to your AppDelegate's `FinishedLaunching(UIApplication, NSDictionary)` method:

```csharp
public override bool FinishedLaunching(UIApplication application, NSDictionary launchOptions)
{
    UNUserNotificationCenter center = UNUserNotificationCenter.Current;
    center.Delegate = this;
    center.RequestAuthorization(UNAuthorizationOptions.Badge | UNAuthorizationOptions.Sound | UNAuthorizationOptions.Alert, (granted, error) =>
    {
        // Handle notification permission response and error, if any.
    });
    UIApplication.SharedApplication.RegisterForRemoteNotifications();
    return true;
}
```

### Configure the Helpshift iOS SDK to handle notifications {#configure-helpshift-sdk}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

When push is not configured, Helpshift SDK shows out-of-the-box "in-app notifications" for every message sent by Agents/Bots.
You should call `RegisterDeviceToken()` API only after you have [configured the Helpshift dashboard](#configure-helpshift-push-admin) for push notifications. Calling the `RegisterDeviceToken()` API without configuring the Helpshift dashboard will stop showing out-of-the-box "in-app notifications" for the end users.

</Admonition>

For Helpshift SDK to work with the Helpshift push notification service, you will need to invoke the `registerDeviceToken:` API call inside the application delegate method `RegisteredForRemoteNotifications(UIApplication, NSData)`

In your app delegate file it will look something like this:

```csharp
public override void RegisteredForRemoteNotifications(UIApplication application, NSData deviceToken)
{
    Helpshift.RegisterPushToken(deviceToken);
}
```

#### If your app uses UNNotification framework {#unnotification-framework}

To respond to the delivery of notifications, you must implement a delegate for the shared UNUserNotificationCenter object. Your delegate object must conform to the UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate protocol, which the notification center uses to deliver notification information to your app:

1. If a notification arrives while your app is in the foreground, UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate's `WillPresentNotification(UNUserNotificationCenter, UNNotification, Action<UNNotificationPresentationOptions>)` is called.
1. The system does not call the `WillPresentNotification(UNUserNotificationCenter, UNNotification, Action<UNNotificationPresentationOptions>)` method when your app is in the background or is not running. In those cases, the system alerts the user according to the information in the notification itself.
1. When the user selects an action from the notification interface, the system notifies your app of the user's choice. To receive responses, your delegate object must implement the `DidReceiveNotificationResponse(UNUserNotificationCenter, UNNotificationResponse, Action)` method.

In all of the above cases, you should check the "origin" field of the notification dictionary and call Helpshift's `HandlePush(object, bool)` API if the origin of the notification is "helpshift". The Helpshift SDK will check Issues for which the notifications were received and will launch the Conversation screen for those Issues automatically. The `isAppLaunch` boolean flag here is used to distinguish between an active or backgrounded app vs. an app that was killed by the user. In the latter case, this flag should be set to true.

Example usage:

For the `WillPresentNotification(UNUserNotificationCenter, UNNotification, Action<UNNotificationPresentationOptions>)` delegate -

```csharp
public void WillPresentNotification(UNUserNotificationCenter center, UNNotification notification, Action<UNNotificationPresentationOptions> completionHandler)
{
    var userInfo = notification.Request.Content.UserInfo;
    if (userInfo["origin"] != null && userInfo["origin"].IsEqual((NSString)"helpshift"))
    {
        Helpshift.HandlePush(notification.Request.Content.UserInfo, false);
        completionHandler(UNNotificationPresentationOptions.None);
    }
    else
    {
        // Handling for non-helpshift push notifications received when app is in foreground
    }
}
```

For the `DidReceiveNotificationResponse(UNUserNotificationCenter, UNNotificationResponse, Action)` delegate -

```csharp
public void DidReceiveNotificationResponse(UNUserNotificationCenter center, UNNotificationResponse response, Action completionHandler)
{
    var userInfo = response.Notification.Request.Content.UserInfo;
    if (userInfo["origin"] != null && userInfo["origin"].IsEqual((NSString)"helpshift"))
    {
        Helpshift.HandlePush(response.Notification.Request.Content.UserInfo, true);
    }
    else
    {
        // Handling for non-helpshift push notifications received when app is in background or killed
    }
    completionHandler();
}
```

## In-app notifications {#in-app-notifications}

In-app notifications are similar to Apple's push notification banners. Unlike push notifications, they appear within your app when it is in use by the user.

These notifications are sent when an agent replies to a customer's issue. Your customers can click on these banners to go straight into the conversation screen.

## Configuring In-app notifications {#optional-flags}

The Helpshift [install call](/sdkx-xamarin/getting-started#initialize) supports flags for configuring SDK behaviour. Currently we support one flag i.e `enableInAppNotification`.

### Enabling/Disabling In-app notifications {#enable-disable-in-app}

<div className="compact ">

|         |                         |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| Flag    | enableInAppNotification |
| Values  | true/false              |
| Default | true                    |

</div>

If you do not want the in-app notifications support provided by the Helpshift SDK, please set this flag to `false`. The default value of this flag is `true` i.e in-app notifications will be enabled.

Example:

```csharp
Dictionary<string, object> installConfig = new Dictionary<string, object>();
installConfig.Add("enableInAppNotification", false);
// Add other install configs...
Helpshift.Install("YOUR_APP_ID", "YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME", installConfig);
```

### Pausing In-app notifications {#pause-in-app}

If you have enabled in-app notifications, use the API `PauseDisplayOfInAppNotification(bool)` to pause/resume the notifications. When `true` is passed to this method, display of in-app notifications is paused even if they arrive. When you pass `false`, the in-app notifications start displaying.

Example:

```csharp
Helpshift.PauseDisplayOfInAppNotification(true); // To temporarily pause in-app notifications
Helpshift.PauseDisplayOfInAppNotification(false); // To resume showing the in-app notifications
```

## Notification badges {#notification-badges}

If you want to show your user notifications for replies you send to the issues they posted, you can use notification counts provided by Helpshift SDK that gives you the total number of unread messages and display it as a badge.
You can get notification counts asynchronously by implementing the `IHelpshiftEventsListener` and listening for `HelpshiftEventNameReceivedUnreadMessageCount` event in the interface's `OnEventOccurred(string, IDictionary<string, object>)` method.
Notifications are typically displayed as badges inside your app where a user invokes the help section.
These badges can be displayed anywhere in your app's interface to tell the user that they have unread replies/messages from you.

```csharp
// call RequestUnreadMessageCount() API first
Helpshift.RequestUnreadMessageCount(true);

// In your IHelpshiftEventsListener implementation...
public void OnEventOccurred(string eventName, IDictionary<string, object> data)
{
    switch(eventName)
    {
        case HelpshiftEvent.RECEIVED_UNREAD_MESSAGE_COUNT:
            var count = data[HelpshiftEvent.DATA_MESSAGE_COUNT];
            // Use count to set the badge count in your app's UI.
            break;
        // other events...
    }
}
```

Refer [Unread Message Count Event](/sdkx-xamarin/delegates/#unread-message-count) for knowing more on how the SDK notifies of the unread count to your app.
