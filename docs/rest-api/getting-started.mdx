## Exploring the REST API with Helpshift's 'API Docs' tool {#intro}

Helpshift provides a simple tool at [https://apidocs.helpshift.com](https://apidocs.helpshift.com) called API Docs that makes it easy to learn about and explore the Helpshift REST APIs.

With the API docs tool, you can explore the full set of REST APIs along with examples and full documentation.

This is an example of the API docs view showing the details of the 'Create Issue' API.

In addition, APIs docs will let you try each API against your own domain providing you with the REST API string, and the actual content returned from each REST API call.

## Accessing the API Docs tool

To access our API docs, navigate to [https://apidocs.helpshift.com](https://apidocs.helpshift.com) and enter your domain name and your domain's default API key.

You will need to have the integrations feature enabled and you will need to have your domains default API key to use the API Docs tool.

** Note: If you do not have the integrations feature enabled, please contact Helpshift to enable the integrations API. **

You can obtain the default API key from the API section of the Helpshift dashboard as seen here:

## What is the REST API

The REST API service enables read/write access into the core Helpshift objects, and access to perform Helpshift actions. These API's can enable a number of custom solutions or extend core features to be embedded into ancillary workflows, tools, or projects.

## Using API Docs to explore the API

Helpshift's API Docs is a tool used to explore the API and many of the available parameters. The tool can be found by clicking through the link [https://apidocs.helpshift.com](https://apidocs.helpshift.com).
For full parameter descriptions and syntax examples we recommend developers frequent the API Docs page.
Practicing calls and filtering those calls is encouraged. Use the following documentation as a top level reference, wherein the API Docs will provide a more thorough experience for discovering what the API can do.
See screenshots of the API Docs tool below:

## Using the REST API

Using the REST API is relatively straight forward. For most calls the syntax is direct and concise, however, there are some areas of the API that are very precise and will require referencing of ancillary API documentation.

## Webhooks

Helpshift Webhooks allow you to set up an integration with a third party service, such as Slack, PowerBI, a bot engine, and others, based on Helpshift events.
You can use the integration to enable notifications via text, email or a communication app whenever a Helpshift event occurs.
Within the Helpshift Dashboard, you can define the conditions required to receive a notification.

From the Helpshift Dashboard, you can define your own HTTP callback to trigger an action or notification through a Helpshift event.
For each Webhook, you'll need to configure corresponding listeners and subscribe it to events.
The Webhook listener will look out for your defined URL for incoming HTTPS POST notification messages.

Detailed instructions on Setting Up Webhooks can be found here [https://support.helpshift.com/kb/article/what-are-helpshift-webhooks-and-how-do-i-set-them-up/](https://support.helpshift.com/kb/article/what-are-helpshift-webhooks-and-how-do-i-set-them-up/)
