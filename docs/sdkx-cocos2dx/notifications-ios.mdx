## Configure push notifications via Helpshift {#push-via-helpshift}

Notifications can be sent to your users when you reply to an issue submitted by them. In addition to the expected Push Notification behavior on iOS, you can customize your notifications to display a numbered badge on your App icon or play a sound alert when a notification is received.

If your app does not already use push, you will need to enable push for your app. To enable push notification in your application you need to add APNS registration code to your AppController.mm's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method:

```objc
- (BOOL) application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    ...
    UNUserNotificationCenter *center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];
    center.delegate = self;
    [center requestAuthorizationWithOptions:(UNAuthorizationOptionBadge | UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionAlert)
                                                                    completionHandler:^(BOOL granted, NSError *_Nullable error) {
        ...
    }];
    [UIApplication sharedApplication registerForRemoteNotifications];
    ...
}
```

### Configure Helpshift's push notification service in the Helpshift admin interface {#configure-helpshift-push-admin}

You can configure this in 4 simple steps:

Setup your application with Apple and enable push notifications.

You need to generate certificates for APNS on Apple's portal that you can later provide to Helpshift. This lets Helpshift send push notifications to your users. Apple has moved away from old type of certificates to Apple Push Notification service SSL. There is another option to create Apple Push Notification Authentication Key, but Helpshift does not support this option yet. It's also possible that you still have the old type of certificate that has not yet expired, this is also supported by Helpshift.

Apple provides two variations of Apple Push Notification service SSL

- Apple Push Notification service SSL (Sandbox)
- Apple Push Notification service SSL (Sandbox & Production)

After creating your certificate, download it. Double click on it to import it to the Keychain Access application. In the Keychain Access application, right click on the certificate that was just added, and click export it in .p12 format. Please provide a password while exporting the certificate since we do not accept empty passwords. (Note that if your development private key is not present in Keychain Access, you will not be able to export it in .p12 format.)

To enable the Helpshift system to send push notifications to your users you will have to add iOS as a platform in your app (if you have not added already). And then click on the push notifications option.

  alt="Add-platform.png"
/>

After export, login and upload the .p12 file in your app in the Helpshift admin panel. Provide the same password you used while exporting to .p12 format.

Please note that you need to use the same bundle identifier in the app as the one you used to create the APNS certificate.

<Image
  src="/static/books/sdkx_ios/Add-certificate.png"
  width="full"
  alt="Add-certificate.png"
/>

You can configure whether to send a badge or not, and sound alerts if you provided custom sounds bundled with your app to handle notifications. Save it and you're all set.

#### Development (Sandbox) mode vs. Production mode

When you build and run your app from Xcode, it is in development (Sandbox) mode. To test push notifications from Helpshift in this mode make sure you choose 'Development Mode' while uploading either of the above two certificate types.

When you publish your app and download from App Store, your app is in Production mode. To test push notifications from Helpshift in production mode make sure you choose 'Production Mode' while uploading a certificate of 'Apple Push Notification service SSL (Sandbox & Production)' type. Sandbox mode certificate will not work on a production environment.

We do not support using the same certificate for both sandbox and production apps. In these cases we recommend you create two separate apps on our dashboard, one in 'Production mode' and the other in 'Development mode'. While testing please use the credentials of the developement mode app. When you are ready to publish, please replace the credentials with those of the production level app.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Your Push Certificate has an expiry date, as indicated in the below screenshot. Helpshift will not send you a reminder when your Push Certificate expires, so please make sure that your developer keeps a tab on the expiry date to reupload the Push Certificate.

### Configure the Helpshift iOS SDK to handle notifications {#configure-helpshift-sdk}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

When push is not configured, Helpshift SDK shows out-of-the-box "in-app notifications" for every message sent by Agents/Bots.
You should call `registerDeviceToken` API only after you have [configured the Helpshift dashboard](#configure-helpshift-push-admin) for push notifications. Calling the `registerDeviceToken` API without configuring the Helpshift dashboard will stop showing out-of-the-box "in-app notifications" for the end users.

</Admonition>

For Helpshift SDK to work with the Helpshift push notification service, you will need to invoke the `registerDeviceToken:` API call inside the application delegate method `application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:`

In your `AppController.mm` file it will look something like this:

```objc
#import <HelpshiftX/Helpshift.h>
...
- (void) application:(UIApplication *)app didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
    [Helpshift registerDeviceToken:deviceToken];
}
```

#### If your app uses UINotification framework (Deprecated) {#uinotification-framework}

When a push notification is received, the application delegate `didReceiveRemoteNotification:` is called. Additionally:

1. If the application was not in the foreground, and the user taps the push notification, this method is called again.
2. In cases where the app might have been killed by the user, and then they tap on a push notification, the application's `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` delegate is called.

In all of the above cases, developers should check the `origin` field of the notification dictionary and call `handleNotificationWithUserInfoDictionary:isAppLaunch` API if the origin of the notification is "Helpshift". The Helpshift SDK will check Issues for which the notifications were received and will launch the Conversation screen for those Issues automatically. The isAppLaunch boolean flag here is used to distinguish between an active or backgrounded app vs. an app that was killed by the user. In the latter case, this flag should be set to true.

Example usage:

When receiving remote notifications when the app starts for the first time, or after being killed by the user:

```objc
#import <HelpshiftX/Helpshift.h>
...
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    ...
    if(launchOptions[UIApplicationLaunchOptionsRemoteNotificationKey]) {
        NSDictionary *userInfo = launchOptions[UIApplicationLaunchOptionsRemoteNotificationKey];
        if([[userInfo objectForKey:@"origin"] isEqualToString:@"helpshift"]) {
            [Helpshift handleNotificationWithUserInfoDictionary:notification.request.content.userInfo
                                                    isAppLaunch:YES
                                                 withController:self.window.rootViewController];
        }
    }
    ...
}

```

For the `didReceiveRemoteNotification:` delegate -

```objc
#import <HelpshiftX/Helpshift.h>
...
- (void) application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo {
    if([[userInfo objectForKey:@"origin"] isEqualToString:@"helpshift"]) {
        [Helpshift handleNotificationWithUserInfoDictionary:notification.request.content.userInfo
                                                isAppLaunch:NO
                                             withController:self.window.rootViewController];
    }
}
```

## In-app notifications {#in-app-notifications}

In-app notifications are similar to Apple's push notification banners. Unlike push notifications, they appear within your app when it is in use by the user.

These notifications are sent when an agent replies to a customer's issue. Your customers can click on these banners to go straight into the conversation screen.

</SideBySide>

## Configuring In-app notifications {#optional-flags}

The Helpshift [install call](/sdkx-cocos2dx/getting-started#initializing) supports flags for configuring SDK behaviour.
Currently we support one flag i.e `enableInAppNotification`.

### Enabling/Disabling In-app notifications {#enable-disable-in-app}

<div className="compact ">

|         |                         |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| Flag    | enableInAppNotification |
| Values  | true/false              |
| Default | true                    |

</div>

If you do not want the in-app notifications support provided by the
Helpshift SDK, please set this flag to `NO`. The default value of this
flag is `YES` i.e in-app notifications will be enabled.<br />

Example:

```cpp

#include "HelpshiftCocos2dx.h"
...

bool AppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching() {

    ValueMap config;
    config["enableInAppNotification"] = false;
    HelpshiftCocos2dx::install( "<App Id from the Helpshift Dashboard>",
                                "<Domain name from the Helpshift Dashboard>",
                                config);
    ...

}

```

### Pausing In-app notifications {#pause-in-app}

If you have enabled in-app notifications, use the API `pauseDisplayOfInAppNotification:` to pause/resume the notifications. When `YES` is passed to this method display of in-app notifications is paused even if they arrive. When you pass a `NO`, the in-app notifications start displaying.

Example:

```cpp
HelpshiftCocos2dx::pauseDisplayOfInAppNotification(true); // To temporarily pause in-app notifications
HelpshiftCocos2dx::pauseDisplayOfInAppNotification(false); // To resume showing the in-app notifications
```

## Notification badges {#notification-badges}

If you want to show your user notifications for replies you send to the
issues they posted, you can use notification counts provided by
Helpshift SDK that gives you the total number of unread messages and
display it as a badge. You can get notification counts asynchronously by
adding listeners using `setHelpshiftEventsListener` [API](/sdkx-cocos2dx/delegates/#helpshift-delegates-implementation). Notifications are typically displayed as badges
inside your app where a user invokes the help section. These badges can
be displayed anywhere in your app's interface to tell the user that they
have unread replies/messages from you.

`HelpshiftCocos2dx::requestUnreadMessageCount(true);`

You can implement something like the following in the notification count delegate method:

```cpp
void handleHelpshiftEvent(const char *eventName, cocos2d::ValueMap &eventData) {
    CCLOG("Event Received: %s", eventName);
    if (strcmp(eventName, RECEIVED_UNREAD_MESSAGE_COUNT) == 0) {
        if (eventData.find(DATA_MESSAGE_COUNT) != eventData.end()) {
            int count = eventData[DATA_MESSAGE_COUNT].asInt();
             // Use count to set the badge count in your app's UI
        }
    }
}
```

to retrieve the unread messages count stored locally and display the unread count similar to mentioned in the above examples.
