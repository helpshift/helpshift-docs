** Release Notes **

- Added support for Android 14.
- SDK X now supports only Android 7, i.e API Level 24, and above. SDK will be non-operational when your app is installed on a device below Android 7 Nougat.
- Moved to AndroidX Support libraries. SDK X will not compile with legacy Android Support libraries anymore.
- Added support for sending multiple attachments in conversations (Support for multiple attachment in bot upload step will be added in Q1`24).
- Added a new API to fetch SDK X version. For more details, [refer here](/sdkx-cocos2dx/support-tools/#get-sdk-version).
- Added a new API to close active SDK session. For more details, [refer here](/sdkx-cocos2dx/support-tools/#close-session).
- Added a new delegate event `agentMessageReceived` when agent sends a message. For more details, [refer here](/sdkx-cocos2dx/delegates/#agent-message-received).
- `HelpshiftCocos2dx::login()` API now returns a boolean indicating whether login was successful or not. This change is in existing API to introduce mandatory validations for login parameters and hence this might affect existing code compilation.
