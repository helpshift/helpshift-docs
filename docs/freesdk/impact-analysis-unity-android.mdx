# Impact Analysis {#performance}

<Intro>

The following numbers are representative of a skeletal sample app
integrated with the Helpshift Unity plugin.

</Intro>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

**App Launch Time**

Since all the Helpshift initialization takes place on a background thread, the Helpshift SDK does not affect app launch times.

</Admonition>

## v10.1.0

### SDK payload in your app {#payload-size}

The Helpshift android plugin will add `162 Kb` to your application's release APK.
The `162 Kb` size includes total impact with all the resources and code.
With the appcompat library which is required for the SDK, it will add around `1MB` of size.

### Method count {#methods-count}

The Helpshift SDK X will add 1088 methods to your dex:

| Package           | Method Count |
| ----------------- | -----------: |
| **com.helpshift** |       `1088` |

### Memory usage {#memory-usage}

| Helpshift API launch                   | Java heap memory (in approx.MB) | Total memory usage(in approx MB) |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------: |
| showFAQs                               | `4.40`                          |                         `95-105` |
| showConversation (conversational mode) | `5.80`                          |                            `135` |

This memory impact will also depend on the device OS and memory configurations on which your app is running.
