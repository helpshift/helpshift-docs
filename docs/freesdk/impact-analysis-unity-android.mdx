# Impact Analysis {#performance}

<Intro>

The following numbers are representative of a skeletal sample app
integrated with the Helpshift Unity plugin.

**App Launch Time**

Since all the Helpshift initialization takes place on a background thread, the Helpshift SDK does not affect app launch times.

## v10.1.0

### SDK payload in your app {#payload-size}

The Helpshift android plugin will add `162 Kb` to your application's release APK. 
The `162 Kb` size includes total impact with all the resources and code. 
With the appcompat library which is required for the SDK, it will add around `1MB` of size.

### Method count {#methods-count}

The Helpshift SDK X will add 1088 methods to your dex:

| Package                                                 | Method Count             |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------:|
| **com.helpshift**                                       |                   `1088`  |

### Memory usage {#memory-usage}


| Helpshift API launch                       | Java heap memory (in approx.MB) | Total memory usage(in approx MB)|
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------:|
| showFAQs                                   |                          `4.40` |                        `95-105` |
| showConversation (conversational mode)     |                          `5.80` |                        `135`    |

This memory impact will also depend on the device OS and memory configurations on which your app is running.
