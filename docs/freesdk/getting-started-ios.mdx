# Getting Started {#getting-started}

<Intro>

Getting started with integrating Helpshift in your iOS app.

</Intro>

## Requirements {#version-requirements}

- Xcode 12.0 and above.
- Cocoapods v1.10.0
- Supported iOS versions:
  - iOS 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10

## Automated Integration using Cocoapods {#cocoapods}

To start using SDK X `v[% sdkx_ios.sdk_version  %]` in your project, add the following line to your `Podfile`

```text

    pod 'HelpshiftX', '[% sdkx_ios.sdk_version  %]'

```

And run `pod install` or `pod update` to refresh your
[cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) dependencies.

You can now move on to [Initializing Helpshift in your App](#initializing).

## Automated Integration using Swift Package Manager {#spm}

To start using Helpshift `v[% sdkx_ios.sdk_version  %]` in your SPM project, add the following package URL to your project's "Package Dependencies" section

```text

    https://github.com/helpshift/HelpshiftX

```

For version rules, we recommend using either "Exact" or "Up to Next Minor" and manually updating the version number when a major version of Helpshift SDK is released.

You can now move on to [Initializing Helpshift in your App](#initializing).

## Manual Integration {#manual-integration}

### Get the latest SDK zip {#getting-sdk}

Download the latest Helpshift iOS SDK from [here](/sdkx_ios/getting-started#getting-sdk).

The zip file contains

<div className="text-sm compact ">

|                        |                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| HelpshiftX.xcframework | The HelpshiftX framework                    |
| NOTICE.txt/            | License information about third-party code. |

</div>

### Add the latest stable SDK release to your project {#add-to-project}

- Unzip the SDK and drag drop `HelpshiftX.xcframework` into your Xcode project
- In the `General` section of your app target, verify that the `HelpshiftX.xcframework` is present in the `Framework, Libraries, and Embedded Content` section
  with the option `Embed and Sign` selected from the Embed options dropdown.
  &nbsp;&nbsp; <Image src="/static/books/sdkx_ios/embed_and_sign_framework.png"  width="full" />
- After successful integration, `Build Phases` should look like this:
  &nbsp;&nbsp; <Image src="/static/books/sdkx_ios/integration_screenshot.png"  width="full" />

### Info.plist changes - Addition of usage description strings {#plist-description-strings}

“User Attachments” feature is enabled for SDK which allows User to upload an attachment. The attachments can be picked from the Photo Library or can be captured directly using the camera. The options for these sources look like:

<Image
  src="/static/books/sdkx_ios/attachment_picker_ios.png"
  width="half"
/>{" "}

To use the camera and photo library, Apple requires the app to have Usage Description strings in the Info.plist while. Failing to add these strings might result in app rejection. The following strings are needed for the attachment feature:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Suggested string</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</td>
    <td>
      “We need to access photos library to allow users manually pick images
      meant to be sent as an attachment for help and support reasons.”
    </td>
    <td>
      This is not needed if your app is iOS 11 or above. Below iOS 11, this key
      is compulsory else the app may crash when user tries to open the photo
      library for attaching photos.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>NSCameraUsageDescription</td>
    <td>
      “We need to access the camera to allow users to click images meant to be
      sent as an attachment for help and support reasons.”
    </td>
    <td>
      This key is needed for capturing a photo using camera and attaching it.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</td>
    <td>
      “We need to access the microphone to allow users to record videos using
      camera meant to be sent as an attachment for help and support reasons.”
    </td>
    <td>
      This key is needed for capturing a video using camera and attaching it.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

End-users can attach files such as pdf, video, etc in their issues. For iOS 10 and below, to access files in the “Files” app of iOS, developers will need to add iCloud capability with iCloud Documents services enabled. For more info please refer the [Prerequisites section here.](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/DocumentPickerProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014451)

### Initializing Helpshift in your app {#initializing}

Helpshift uniquely identifies each registered App using a combination
of 2 tokens:

<div className=" compact">

|                          |                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <code>Platform ID</code> | This is your platform Id.                                                                    |
| <code>Domain Name</code> | This is your Helpshift domain name e.g. _happyapps.helpshift.com_                            |
| <code>Config</code>      | An <code>NSDictionary</code> representing the configuration parameters for the installation. |

</div>

You can find these by navigating to `Settings`>`SDK (for Developers)` in your agent dashboard.
Select your App and _check `iOS` as a platform_ from the dropdowns and copy
the 2 tokens to be passed when initializing Helpshift.

<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

** Placing the install call **

You should not place the install call anywhere other than `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`
Placing it elsewhere might cause unexpected runtime problems.
Helpshift install call will throw `InstallException` in case the validation of the SDK keys fail.

</Admonition>

## Integrating Feedback Section {#conversation-view}

You can use the API call `showConversationWith:config:` to allow a user to directly send feedback without having to first view FAQs. This API call will show the feedback screen to the User.

<Centered >

![](/static/books/freesdk/iosfeedback.png)

</Centered>

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Objective-C Example" label="Objective-C Example">

```
	NSDictionary *config = @{ @"initialUserMessage": @"Give Feedback" };
    [Helpshift showConversationWith:self config:config];

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Swift Example" label="Swift Example">

```
	let config = ["initialUserMessage": "Give Feedback"]
    Helpshift.showConversation(with:self, config:config)

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Integrating FAQs {#faqs-view}

You can use the API call `showFAQsWith:config:` to provide a way for the user to invoke the purpose-built help/support section in your app. This is the easiest approach to enable help in your app as it bundles all the capabilities of the Helpshift SDK in a simple and intuitive interface. You can wire this API call to a **"Help"** or **"FAQs"** action in your app.

    [Helpshift showFAQsWith:self config:config];

```

<TabItem value="Swift Example" label="Swift Example">

```
	let config = ["initialUserMessage": "Give Feedback"]
    Helpshift.showFAQs(with:self, config:config)

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Attaching Custom Metadata to feedback {#custom-meta-data}

You can attach additional metadata to every new feedback started by the app user. This metadata can include properties like username, email, game scores, current game levels, and any other data needed to provide relevant context for each new feedback. You can attach custom metadata passing it to the `config` dictionary at the time of calling any of the SDK APIs (`showConversation`, `showFAQs`).

Example:-

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Configuration details" label="Configuration details">

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Objective-C" label="Objective-C">

```
NSDictionary *customMetadata = @{ @"usertype": @"paid",
                                  @"level": @"7",
                                  @"score": @"12345"
 };

NSDictionary *config = @{ @"customMetadata" : customMetadata };
[Helpshift showConversationWith:self config:config];
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Swift" label="Swift">

```swift
let customMetadata = [ "usertype": "paid",
                       "level": "7",
                       "score": "12345" ];
let config = ["customMetadata":customMetadata]
Helpshift.showConversation(with: self, config: config)
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Metadata should only be sent as String key-value pairs.

- Once customMetadata is set, if you want to reset it, then you’ll have to call the SDK X API with an empty dictionary, i.e.,

```swift
let customMetadata = [String: String]();
let config = ["customMetadata":customMetadata]
Helpshift.showConversation(with: self, config: config)
```

</Admonition>

## Attaching Custom Issue Fields to feedback {#custom-issue-fields}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

**On Custom Issue Fields keys & compatibility**

- Custom Issue Fields must be created in the Helpshift Dashboard (Settings → Custom Issue Fields), otherwise they will be ignored. Read more [here](https://support.helpshift.com/kb/article/custom-issue-fields/)

</Admonition>

You can attach Custom Issue Fields to every new feedback started by the user. A Custom Issue Field should have a key, a datatype, and a value. The Helpshift SDK allows the addition of Custom Issue Fields by using the `cifs` method in the ApiConfig object.
These Custom Issue Fields would be sent whenever a new feedback is started by the end user.

As soon as an end user opens the feedback screen, they see a greeting message, and the feedback is considered active.
All the modified Custom Issue Fields (updated during an active feedback) will only be sent with the next feedback that end user starts.

Possible datatypes to be passed into the config are:

| Type         | value         | Comments                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "singleline" | string        | Single line string with character limit of 255                                                                                                                |
| "multiline"  | string        | Multi line string with character limit of 100,000                                                                                                             |
| "number"     | string        | String representation of number. For eg. "12345"                                                                                                              |
| "dropdown"   | string        | Drop-down options should exist for the given Custom Issue Field on dashboard. Value should be one of the values specified on the dashbaord for that dropdown. |
| "date"       | long long int | Epoch time in milliseconds. For eg. `1505927361535`                                                                                                           |
| "checkbox"   | string        | String representation of boolean. For eg. "true" or "false". This corresponds to the checkbox type custom issue field on dashboard.                           |
