## Responsive Mobile View

The following meta tag should be added in the head of the client website, and the website should be mobile friendly in order to have the perfect Helpshift Widget experience on the mobile devices:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

## Local Storage

[Local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) is a prerequisite for the Helpshift Widget. If your user has disabled local storage, the Helpshift Widget will not work.
