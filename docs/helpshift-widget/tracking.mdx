<Intro>

Attach metadata via Helpshift Widget.

</Intro>

## Adding Tags to Conversations {#adding-tags}

You can attach tags while reporting an issue by passing them to the `helpshiftWidgetConfig` object at the time of initialization. You can pass an **array of strings** which will get added as Tags when the issue is created.

For example:

```javascript
// Make this change to the embed code placed before the closing </body> tag.

window.helpshiftWidgetConfig = {
  platformId: "<YOUR_APP_ID>",
  domain: "<YOUR_DOMAIN>",
  tags: ["foo", "bar"],
};
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

**On tag names & compatibility**

- Tags must be pre-created in the Helpshift Dashboard (Settings → Tags), otherwise they will be ignored.
- The attached tags must exactly match the tags present on the dashboard.

## Set Custom Issue Fields {#set-custom-issue-fields}

If you want to set Custom Issue Fields at the time of issue creation, you can pass them to the `helpshiftWidgetConfig` object at the time of initialization.

```javascript

window.helpshiftWidgetConfig = {
  platformId: "<YOUR_APP_ID>",
  domain: "<YOUR_DOMAIN>",
  cifs: {
    // Key of the Custom Issue Field
    version: {
        // Type of Custom Issue Field
        type: "number",
        // Value to set for Custom Issue Field
        value: "10.0",
    },
    userInfo: {
        // Type of Custom Issue Field
        type: "singleline",
        // Value to set for Custom Issue Field
        value: "We have a new user!",
    },
  }
};
```

The following are the valid values for the type property of a Custom Issue Field.

- singleline
- multiline
- number
- checkbox
- dropdown
- date

Compatibility table for type and values:

| Type       | Value   | Comments                                                        |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| singleline | string  | Character limit of 255                                          |
| multiline  | string  | Character limit of 100,000                                      |
| number     | string  |                                                                 |
| dropdown   | string  | Drop-down options should exist for the given Custom Issue Field |
| date       | number  | Epoch time. For example - **Date.now()**                        |
| checkbox   | boolean |                                                                 |

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

- This config should be called before the issue is created (i.e. before the Helpshift Widget launcher is clicked or the "[open](/helpshift-widget/api/#open-widget)" API is called). You won't be able to update Custom Issue Fields after the issue is created.
- If any of the keys, types or values are invalid, that particular Custom Issue Field will get dropped.
- If you want to update the Custom Issue Fields for subsequent issue creations, you need to update the cifs config in the helpshiftWidgetConfig object and then use the [updateHelpshiftWidgetConfig](/helpshift-widget/api/#update-helpshift-widget-config) API to update the Custom Issue Fields for subsequent issue creations.
