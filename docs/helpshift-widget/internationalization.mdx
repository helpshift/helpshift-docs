## Setting a Language {#setting-a-language}

You can set the code of the language to be used by Helpshift Widget in the `helpshiftWidgetConfig` object.

### Example Embed Code

```javascript
var PLATFORM_ID = "foo",
  DOMAIN = "bar";

window.helpshiftWidgetConfig = {
  platformId: PLATFORM_ID,
  domain: DOMAIN,
  // other options, if applicable
  // Set language to French ("fr")
  language: "de",
};
```

Here's a screenshot of how Helpshift Widget will look after setting the language to French.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

In order to ensure a smooth migration for existing users, the default language is set to English (`en`) i.e. if you don't set the `language` option in the `helpshiftWidgetConfig` object, Helpshift Widget will use English as the language. You can set it to `browserDefault` in case you want your Helpshift Widget experience to be in the browser's language.
