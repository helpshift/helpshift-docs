Localizing & Internationalizing your in-app Support.

</Intro>

## Internationalization {#i18n}

Helpshift iOS SDK comes with support for **47** languages out of the box with English as the default. To enable the available languages, simply drag & drop the HsLocalization.bundle to your project.
The Helpshift SDK will be localized based on the user’s device language. This can be set by going to General → Language & Region → iPhone Language. If the user’s device language is not available, English will be used as default.

If the end-user has a language already set for their device (via
Settings->General->International->Language) the correct language
translations will be used. If the said language is not available English
will be used as default.

## Localization setup {#localization}

The Helpshift localized strings come bundled in the DLL. If you have already integrated an older version of the SDK, we would recommend
removing the `HSLocalization` folder.

To customize the localzied strings, [follow these steps.](/xamarin/string-customization-ios#string-customization)

## Set SDK language {#set-language}

You can set the SDK language using the method `HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftCore.SetLanguage`

For Example :

Setting SDK language for the given locale with only language code.

```csharp

    HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftCore.SetLanguage("fr");
```
