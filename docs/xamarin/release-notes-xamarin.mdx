# Release Notes

<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

With the transition to TLSv1.2 on Sep 20,2021, connections to a Helpshift SDK via any previous TLS version will not work as expected. Specifically, this means that:

- Helpshift SDKs will not work or load on lower-end Android devices (meaning, Android 4.x and earlier), because these lower-end Android versions do not support TLSv1.2.
- End-users on lower-end Android devices will not be able to access FAQs, raise new issues, or access their past support conversations.
- On a lower-end Android device, the mobile app that embeds a Helpshift SDK will be prevented from communicating with the SDK for any purpose. However, this disconnect will not cause any malfunction or crash on the parent application.

## v3.5.0

_October 28, 2020_

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

3.5.0 Plugin Update

We found a Bug in plugin release 3.5.0 - Bot Options don't show up to end users when the Bot is triggered via New Issue Automation (NIA)

Note: The issue gets fixed when user closes and reopens the chat screen.

**Action needed:**

- If you are planning to integrate or are in the process of integrating SDK 3.5.0, we recommend integrating with 3.5.1 instead.
- If you have already released any of your apps with the affected SDKs and your New Issue Automation triggers options bot, we recommend that you upgrade to 3.5.1 SDK.

</Admonition>

** Release Notes **

** iOS **

- Updated to iOS SDK version 7.9.0. [View](https://developers.helpshift.com/ios/release-notes#790)
- Helpshift iOS SDK is now fully compatible with iOS 14. This will be the last SDK version to support iOS 10. We recommend you to use the latest SDK since apps using Older SDKs (< v7.9.0 ) will see the following degraded behavior for in-app support when run on iOS 14:

  - Apps built with Xcode 12 will crash when user taps on a notification sent from Helpshift dashboard for agent/bot replies.
  - Due to a [bug in Xcode 12](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/656524), close button on chat screen is not visible when a new conversation started and conversation history is OFF.

** Android **

- Updated to Android SDK `v7.9.0` [View](/android/release-notes#v790)
- Helpshift Android SDK is now fully compatible with Android 11. We recommend you to use the latest SDK since apps using Older SDKs (<=3.4.0 version) will see the following degraded behavior for Helpshift messaging experience on Android 11 devices when the app’s targetSDKVersion is set to 30:
  - App will crash when user starts a new conversation from a form-based experience.
  - Image orientation changes on some Android 11 devices when the user uploads an image.
  - If the issue filing flow is form-based then menu items are not clickable on the form when the app is in full screen mode. [View Impact](/android/troubleshooting#known-issues)
