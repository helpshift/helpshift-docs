# Helpshift Delegates {#delegates}

<Intro>

The Helpshift SDK provides delegate callbacks to help app developers track a user's activities within the help section.

</Intro>

## Helpshift Delegates implementation {#helpshift-delegates-implementation}

You have to define a class which implements Helpshift Delegates, and then
pass this to Helpshift using the `HelpshiftSupport.SetDelegate(ISupportDelegate delegateInstance)` method.

For example:

Class Implementation:

```csharp
using HelpshiftApi;

public class  HSDelegate : ISupportDelegate {

    public HSDelegate () {

    }

    public void AuthenticationFailed(HelpshiftUser user, AuthenticationFailureReason reason)
    {
        // Your code here
    }

    public void ConversationEnded()
    {
        // Your code here
    }

    public void DidCheckIfConversationActive(bool isActive)
    {
        // Your code here
    }

    public void DidReceiveNotification(int count)
    {
        // Your code here
    }

    public void DidReceiveUnreadMessagesCount(int count)
    {
        // Your code here
    }

    public bool HandleTapOnAttachmentFile(string path)
    {
        // Your code here
    }

    public void NewConversationStarted(string message)
    {
        // Your code here
    }

    public void SessionBegan()
    {
        // Your code here
    }

    public void SessionEnded()
    {
        // Your code here
    }

    public void UserCompletedCustomerSatisfactionSurvey(int rating, string feedback)
    {
        // Your code here
    }

    public void UserRepliedToConversation(string reply)
    {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

Class Usage:

```csharp
HSDelegate delegateObject = new HSDelegate ();
HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport.SetDelegate(delegateObject);
```

Please make sure you call the `setDelegate` method before calling any Helpshift FAQ
or Conversation API so that they can callback your delegate methods.

To know more about delegate methods, see [Helpshift Session delegates](#session-delegates).

## Helpshift Session delegates {#session-delegates}

### Session begin

**SessionBegan**

If you want to keep track of when helpshift session starts in your app, you can implement this delegate callback. The delegate will get fired every time the Helpshift session starts.

### Session end

**SessionEnded**

If you want to keep track of when helpshift session ends in your app, you can implement this delegate callback. The delegate will get fired every time the Helpshift session ends.

## New conversation delegate {#delegate-new-conversation-started}

**NewConversationStarted**

If you want to keep track of when your app users start a new conversation through Helpshift, you can implement this delegate callback . The delegate will be fired every time the user starts a new conversation. The delegate method will receive the conversation message in its arguments.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

As soon as an end user opens the conversation screen, they see a greeting message, and the conversation is considered active.

</Admonition>

### Conversation Active

**DidCheckIfConversationActive**

This delegate callback can be implemented to check if a Conversation is active when queried via [HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport.CheckIfConversationActive()](/xamarin/tracking-ios#check-if-conversation-active)

## New message delegate {#delegate-user-replied-to-conversation}

**UserRepliedToConversation**

If you want to keep track of when your app users send new messages to an ongoing conversation, you can implement this delegate. This delegates will get called every time a user replies to a conversation. The delegate method will receive the new message's content in its arguments. if the message is of a special type then it will be one of the following four messages.

```csharp

    public const String HSUserAcceptedTheSolution = "User accepted the solution";
    public const String HSUserRejectedTheSolution = "User rejected the solution";
    public const String HSUserSentScreenShot = "User sent a screenshot";
    public const String HSUserReviewedTheApp = "User reviewed the app";

```

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

All the replies from end users to Bot (QuickSearch Bot, Identity Bot) are also considered as new messages added by end users.

</Admonition>

## Conversation ended delegate {#delegate-conversation-ended}

**ConversationEnded**

This delegate is called whenever the ongoing Conversation is resolved, rejected from the Dashboard, timed out or archived.

## Customer satisfaction survey delegate {#csat-completed}

**UserCompletedCustomerSatisfactionSurvey**

If you want to keep track of when your app user completes the customer satisfaction survey for a conversation, you can implement this delegate. This delegates will get called every time a user completes the customer satisfaction survey. The delegate method will receive the rating and the feedback in it's arguments.

## Handle attachment file delegate {#handle-tap-on-attachment}

**HandleTapOnAttachmentFile**

Agents can attach a wide variety of files when replying to users. Following types of file formats are currently supported:

- Video files (3gp, m4v)
- Audio files (mp3, mp4, aac)
- Image files (jpg, png, gif)

After the end user taps on a downloaded attachment, helpshift tries to call the HandleTapOnAttachmentFile delegate(if implemented) and check its return value. If the delegate returns true, then SDK assumes that the host app has handled the opening of attachment and does not take any further action.

If the delegate is not implemented or the delegate returns false, SDK tries to preview it using QLPreviewController.

## Did Receive Notification Count Delegate {#notif-count}

**DidReceiveNotification**

If you want to keep a count of all new messages received in an existing conversation, you can implement this delegate. This delegate will get called with the current unread count every time when helpshift receives a new message in an existing conversation. You can also use this delegate to keep your badge counts updated.

## Did Receive Unread Messages Count {#unread-messages-count}

**DidReceiveUnreadMessagesCount**

This delegate can be implemented to get the count of unread messages queried via [HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport.RequestUnreadMessagesCount(bool)](/xamarin/notifications-ios#showing-notification-count)

## Action card delegate {#action-card-delegate}

This delegate method is called when user clicks on action card button. The `HelpshiftActionType actionType` parameter can be one of:

- Link
- Call

The `data` parameter can be url/phoneNumber based on actionType

Example:

```csharp

    public void UserDidClickOnActionWithTypeAndData(HelpshiftActionType actionType, string data)
    {
        // your code here
    }
```
