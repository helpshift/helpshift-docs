### 3.5.0 SDK Update {#3}

We found a bug for the following scenario - for SDK 3.5.0, when New Issue Automations(NIAs) are used to assign to a Custom Bot and if the first step in the bot is a Get Info from User step with Options, the Options donâ€™t show up to the end user till they go back and come to the conversation screen again.

**Action needed:**

- If you are planning to integrate or are in the process of integrating SDK 3.5.0, we recommend integrating with 3.5.1 instead.
- If you have already released any of your apps with the affected SDKs and your New Issue Automation triggers options bot, we recommend that you upgrade to [3.5.1 SDK](/xamarin/release-notes-xamarin#v351).

### Campaign notification shows "Support" as its title.

Please make sure to set the _"CFBundleDisplayName"_ key, in your application's _Info.plist_ file, to the display name of your application.

Helpshift SDK uses the value of this key as the title of the notification. If this key isn't set then the notification by default shows "Support" as the title.
