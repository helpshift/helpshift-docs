The Helpshift Android SDK supports 47 languages out of the box with
English as default. The translation strings used by the SDK can be
found in the `strings.xml` file, under the following folders -

If the end-user has a language already set for their device, the correct
language translations will be used. If the said language is not
available, English will be used by default.

To add your own language, you need to provide the translated strings
inside `strings.xml` under the appropriate folder. For example, in
order to support the Japanese language, you need to place `strings.xml`
with the translated strings under `values-ja` folder.

For more information, refer to
[Android's Language Support Guide](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/supporting-devices/languages.html)

# Set SDK language {#language-change-programatically}

You can set the SDK language for the given locale using the method `HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport.SetSDKLanguage`

Locale can contain two-letter lowercase ISO language codes (such as "en") as defined by ISO 639-1 and in addition contain two-letter uppercase ISO country codes (such as "US")as defined by ISO 3166-1. Language code and country code are separated by an underscore ("\_"). Example - "pt_BR", "zh_CN".

For example :

Setting SDK language for the given locale with only language code.

```csharp
    HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftCore.SetLanguage("fr");
```

Setting the SDK language for the given locale with both language code and country code.

```csharp
    HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftCore.SetLanguage("zh_CN");
```

Before you set the language, make sure that there exists translations for the Helpshift strings in that locale. List of supported locale is mentioned above.
If there is a locale which we currently do not support out of the box, please add the relevant translation files in your app.
