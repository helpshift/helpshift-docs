# String Customization {#string-customization}

<Intro>

Customize all the strings in Helpshift SDK's user interface


</Intro>

You can customize almost all the strings in the Helpshift SDK with additional
internationalization options. For string customization please follow steps below :

1. Find the resource-id of the string that you want to change. See
   [String resources in sdk](#string-resources) for the full list of strings.

2. Create a resource with the above id in your strings.xml file.

3. Compile and check.

Read [Going International](/xamarin/i18n-android/) if you want to change the strings for a particular
language or want to add a language translation of your own.
