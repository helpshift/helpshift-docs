# Deep Linking in FAQs {#ios-deep-links}

<Intro>

Using custom URL schemes to support deep linking in your app

</Intro>

Use custom URL schemes to direct users to particular sections of your app from Helpshift FAQs. You can use these schemes to provide a more seamless experience for the user. For example, if your iOS app has a registration screen, clicking on a registration link in an FAQ can directly take the user to that screen.

## Insert custom URL schemes in FAQs {#custom-url-in-faqs}

When editing your FAQ, select the text and then click on create a link.

<Image
  src="/static/books/misc/add-ios-deep-link-1.png"
  width="half"
  alt="add-ios-deep-link-1.png"
/>{" "}

In the dialog that pops up, enter your custom URL and save the FAQ.

<Image
  src="/static/books/misc/add-ios-deep-link-2.png"
  width="half"
  alt="add-ios-deep-link-2.png"
/>{" "}

If you want to use built-in support for deep links with FAQs, please use the following scheme for specifying the links

```

    <scheme>://helpshift/section/<publish-id>
    <scheme>://helpshift/faq/<publish-id>

```
