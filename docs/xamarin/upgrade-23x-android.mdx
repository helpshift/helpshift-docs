# Upgrading from 2.3.x to 2.4.0 {#upgrade-to-240}

<Intro>

The Helpshift SDK v2.4.0 is a major update. Please note the we have deprecated some APIs. If you have questions or feedback, please <a href="https://support.helpshift.com/kb/contact/" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>

</Intro>

## List of deprecated APIs {#deprecated-api}

| Deprecated API                                       | New API                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport IsConversationActive   | HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport CheckIfConversationActive  |
| HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport GetNotificationCount   | HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport RequestUnreadMessagesCount |
| Helpshift Delegate API "DidReceiveNotificationCount" | Helpshift delegate API "DidReceiveUnreadMessagesCount"   |
|                                                      |                                                          |

## Check active Conversation {#check-active-conversation}

On SDK version 2.3.1 or below, you can check if an active conversation exists as shown below:

```java
HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport.IsConversationActive();
```

Starting from SDK version 2.4.0, a new api and a delegate method is introduced to check if an active conversation exists.

The example code is shown below:

```java
HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport.CheckIfConversationActive();
```

Implement the delegate interface method `DidCheckIfConversationActive`

```csharp
public class  HSDelegate : Com.Helpshift.Xamarin.Support.HelpshiftSupport.IDelegate {

    .
    .
    .
    .
    .
    .

    public void DidCheckIfConversationActive(bool isActive) {
       // your code here
    }
}

```

For more information, see [Check Active Conversation)(/xamarin/tracking-android#checkifconversationactive)

## Show count of unread messages saved locally {#unread-count-saved-locally-example-snippet}

On SDK version 2.3.1 or below, unread messages count can be obtained both synchronously and asynchronously. This is changed in SDK version 2.4.0 and unread message count is always obtained asynchronously.

As an example, if you want to get the locally saved unread messages count and you're on SDK 2.3.1 or earlier versions, you would use code like shown below:

```java
HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport.GetNotificationCount(false);
```

Starting from SDK version 2.4.0, you can retrieve the locally stored unread messages count as shown below:

```java
HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport.RequestUnreadMessagesCount(false);
```

Implement the delegate interface method `DidReceiveUnreadMessagesCount`

```csharp
public class  HSDelegate : Com.Helpshift.Xamarin.Support.HelpshiftSupport.IDelegate {

    .
    .
    .
    .
    .
    .

    public void DidReceiveUnreadMessagesCount(int count) {
        // your code here
    }
}

```

## Show count of unread messages from server {#unread-count-remote-example-snippet}

On SDK version 2.3.1 or below, unread messages count can be obtained both synchronously and asynchronously. This is changed in SDK version 2.4.0 and unread message count is always obtained asynchronously.

As an example, if you want to fetch the latest unread messages count from the server and you're on SDK 2.3.1 or earlier versions, you would use code like shown below:

```java
HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport.GetNotificationCount(true);
```

Starting from SDK version 2.4.0, you can retrieve the unread messages count from server as shown below:

```java
HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport.RequestUnreadMessagesCount(true);
```

Implement the delegate interface method `DidReceiveUnreadMessagesCount`

```csharp
public class  HSDelegate : Com.Helpshift.Xamarin.Support.HelpshiftSupport.IDelegate {

    .
    .
    .
    .
    .
    .

    public void DidReceiveUnreadMessagesCount(int count) {
        // your code here
    }
}

```
