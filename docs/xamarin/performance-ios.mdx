### Disk Space

This is the amount of disk space the static library takes up.

The total size of library is 25.8 MBs.

The breakage is as follows:

| Architecture | Size (MB) |
|--------------|-----------|
| arm64        | 6.4       |

If you are using the bitcode version of the library then Helpshift adds around `2.15` MB size.

### Ram usage

Memory usage (Bitcode enabled in debug mode)

**Helpshift's `install call` (installForApiKey:)** : adds around 0.9 MB of memory with peak usage of 1 MB (for 1-2 seconds). So around 0.9MB of memory is used when a Helpshift screen in not engaged.

**Helpshift's FAQ screens (showFAQs:)** adds: ~ 6 MB of memory. (This depends on the number of FAQs and section in the host app).

**Single section**: adds peak 5 MB peak, settled at 1 MB.

**Single faq**: adds ~ 4 MB memory (This depends upon the faq content).

**Helpshift's New Chat screen (showConversation:)** adds: ~1 MB


| | |

|**Helpshift's Campaigns Inbox screen (showInbox:)**| adds around 3 MB of memory for an average of 5 Campaigns on the device. Please note that this number will vary depending on the number of campaigns received and the resolution of the icon images used in the Campaigns.|

## v1.0.0


### Disk space

The combined library size (libHelpshift.a) is 9.9 MB.
The breakup is as follows:

| Architecture              | Size (MB) |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| i386 + x86_64 (simulator) | 4.6       |
| armv7                     | 1.7       |
| armv7s                    | 1.7       |
| arm64                     | 2.4       |

When compiled with an app for deployment on the app store, armv7, armv7s and arm64 will be taken up and i386+x86_64 or the simulator architectures will be ignored.

### Sample compiled payload size using a demo app {#demoapp-payload-size}

The app store size was estimated using Xcode's "Estimated App Store
Size" feature for archived product build.

On an average, Helpshift Unity SDK for iOS adds 550KB per architecture.

### SDK memory usage {#memory-usage}

Memory usage for the SDK support screen launches.

| Support API launch | Memory Usage (approx. MB) |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| showConversation (with no Conversation) | 6.01 |
| showConversation (with already running Conversation) | 6.56 |
| showFAQs | 9.87 |
| showFAQSection | 9.50 |
| showSingleFAQ | 6.23 |


<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Tested with a demo app. Usage will increase with number of FAQs and
number of messages in a conversation.
