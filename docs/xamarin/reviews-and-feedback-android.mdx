# Reviews & Feedback {#review-and-feedback}

<Intro>

Asking for reviews and feedback

</Intro>

## Review reminder in SDK {#review-reminder}

Helpshift SDK adds a way for customers to send feedback in review reminders.

The review reminder is shown in the app to the user. It takes the user to [New Conversation](/xamarin/support-tools-android#conversation-view) screen.

In this way, you can reduce possible negative reviews into genuine problems to be solved.

## Manual App Rating request{#app-rating-api}

Manual app rating requests can be triggered by using the `HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport.ShowAlertToRateApp` API, which prompts the user to rate your app, or send feedback.

Example:

```csharp
public class RateAppListener : MainActivity, Com.Helpshift.Xamarin.Listeners.IHelpshiftAlertToRateAppListener
    {
        public RateAppListener () {
        }

        public void OnAction(int action)
        {
            if (action == HelpshiftApi.RateAlert.Close) {
                //your code here
            } else if (action == HelpshiftApi.RateAlert.Success) {
                //your code here
            } else if (action ==  HelpshiftApi.RateAlert.Feedback) {
                //your code here
            } else if (action == HelpshiftApi.RateAlert.Fail) {
                //your code here
            }
        }
    }
```

Class Usage:

```csharp
    HelpshiftApi.HelpshiftSupport.ShowAlertToRateApp("market://details?id=com.RunnerGames.game.YooNinja_Lite",new RateAppListener());
```

## Automatic review requests {#configure-review-request}

Automatic review requests can be triggered on two kinds of events:

- After a specific number of app launches
- After a specific number of days since the first app launch

To enable automatic review requests, navigate to **SDK Configurations** for your app in agent dashboard and select a value from **Ask for review after every** dropdown.

Automatic review requests, if enabled via admin, will be shown **once per app version**.

## Customer satisfaction survey {#csat}

Customer satisfaction survey prompts your app users to rate their customer support experience with your agents. Enabling it, sends out a 5-star customer service rating request to your customers when an issue is resolved.

To enable it, go to Settings in your agent dashboard, and then under app settings, select your app. You can enable `Customer satisfaction survey` from under SDK Configurations.

When an issue is resolved, and your customer accepts the resolution, then a Customer Satisfaction screen is shown.

Your customer can also (optionally) give feedback to help you improve the quality of your service.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

You can also update the review URL for your app via **SDK Configurations** in agent dashboard.
A google play store URL should look like `market://details?id=com.RunnerGames.game.YooNinja_Lite`.
