## Support for Swift {#support-for-swift}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Helpshift SDK is not fully compatible with Unity 2019.3.x or above versions and requires some manual steps. Refer [this guide](/unity/troubleshooting-ios#2019.3-support) for more details.

## Granting iCloud permission for iOS 10 and below {#icloud-capability}

With version 5.3.0, End-users will be able to send files such as pdf, video, etc. where before 5.3.0 end-users could only send images. For iOS 10 and below, to access files in the “Files” app of iOS, developers will need to add iCloud capability with iCloud Documents services enabled.
