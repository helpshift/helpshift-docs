# Impact Analysis {#performance}

<Intro>

The following numbers are representative of a skeletal sample app
integrated with the Helpshift Unity plugin.

## v5.6.0

### Disk space

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Tested with Unity 2019.4.20f1, Xcode 12.0 built demo app on iPhone X running iOS 14.0. Memory Usage will increase with number of FAQs and number of messages in a conversation.

</Admonition>

When an Unity iOS app is integrated with Helpshift framework, the increase in the size of IPA file is around `3.8` MB for both bitcode and non-bitcode variants of the framework.

If your app is not already using swift, there will be an additional `~2.6` MB size addition in the final downloaded IPA for OS versions below iOS 12.2.

Impact analysis for support only native framework can be found [here](/ios/performance#7110).

### iOS 6 deprecation

Starting with unity plugin version 2.x, we officially dropped support for iOS 6.
But we had kept the code handling the differences in platforms iOS 6 and below.
With SDK version 2.3.0 and above, we have now removed all handling in our code so running your application on iOS 6 is likely to cause runtime crashes and bad behaviour.

## v2.2.0-support

The combined library size (libSupport.a) is 15.8 MB.
The breakup is as follows:

| Architecture              | Size (MB) |
| ------------------------- | --------- |
| i386 + x86_64 (simulator) | 5.8       |
| armv7                     | 3         |
| armv7s                    | 3         |
| arm64                     | 4         |

When compiled with an app for deployment on the app store, armv7, armv7s and arm64 will be taken up and i386+x86_64 or the simulator architectures will be ignored.

### Sample compiled payload size using a demo app {#demoapp-payload-size}

Helpshift SDK would add about 1.3 MB to your app's bundle.

### SDK memory usage {#memory-usage}

Memory usage for the SDK support screen launches.
Helpshift's install call will add around 1.2 MB of memory usage to your
app.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Memory usage tested with a demo app. Usage will increase with number of FAQs and
number of messages in a conversation.
