# Impact Analysis {#performance}

<Intro>

The following numbers are representative of a skeletal sample app
integrated with the Helpshift Unity plugin.

**App Launch Time**

Since all the Helpshift initialization takes place on a background thread, the Helpshift SDK does not affect app launch times.

## v5.6.0

### Disk space


<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Tested with Unity 2019.4.20f1, Xcode 12.0 built demo app on iPhone X running iOS 14.0. Memory Usage will increase with number of FAQs and number of messages in a conversation.

</Admonition>


When an Unity iOS app is integrated with Helpshift framework, the increase in the size of IPA file is around `3.8` MB for both bitcode and non-bitcode variants of the framework.

If your app is not already using swift, there will be an additional `~2.6` MB size addition in the final downloaded IPA for OS versions below iOS 12.2.

Impact analysis for support only native framework can be found [here](/ios/performance#7110).

Memory usage (In debug mode. Values are approximate.)

When deployed in an iOS app, the final linked static library size is around `2.15 MBs`.

### RAM usage


| | |
|--|--|
|**Helpshift's install call (installForApiKey:)**| adds around 0.8 MB of memory with peak usage of 1.1 MB (for 1-2 seconds). So around 0.8 MB of memory is used when a Helpshift screen in not engaged.|

## v2.3.0

Sample app running on a iPhone 6.

### Disk space

This is the amount of disk space the static library takes up.
The total size of library is `22.3 MBs`.
The breakup is as follows:

| Architecture | Size (MB) |

| arm64        | 5.7       |
| armv7        | 4.2       |
| armv7s       | 4.2       |
| simulator    | 8.2       |

When deployed in an iOS app, the final linked static library size is around `1.9 MBs`.

### RAM usage


| | |
|--|--|
|**Helpshift's install call (installForApiKey:)**| adds around 1.03 MB of memory with peak usage of 1.06 MB (for 1-2 seconds). So around 1.03 MB of memory is used when a Helpshift screen in not engaged.|
|**Helpshift's FAQ screens (showFAQ:)**| around 10 MB of memory.|
|**Helpshift's Conversation screen (showConversation:)**| adds around 6.6 MB of memory.|
|**Helpshift's Campaigns Inbox screen (showInbox:)**| adds around 3 MB of memory for an average of 5 campaigns on the device. Please note that this number will vary depending on the number of campaigns received and the resolution of the icon images used in the Campaigns.|
### iOS 6 deprecation

Starting with unity plugin version 2.x, we officially dropped support for iOS 6.
But we had kept the code handling the differences in platforms iOS 6 and below.
With SDK version 2.3.0 and above, we have now removed all handling in our code so running your application on iOS 6 is likely to cause runtime crashes and bad behaviour.

## v2.2.0-support

The combined library size (libSupport.a) is 15.8 MB.
The breakup is as follows:

| Architecture              | Size (MB) |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| i386 + x86_64 (simulator) | 5.8       |
| armv7                     | 3         |
| armv7s                    | 3         |
| arm64                     | 4         |

When compiled with an app for deployment on the app store, armv7, armv7s and arm64 will be taken up and i386+x86_64 or the simulator architectures will be ignored.

### Sample compiled payload size using a demo app {#demoapp-payload-size}

Helpshift SDK would add about 1.3 MB to your app's bundle.

### SDK memory usage {#memory-usage}

Memory usage for the SDK support screen launches.
Helpshift's install call will add around 1.2 MB of memory usage to your
app.


<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Memory usage tested with a demo app. Usage will increase with number of FAQs and
number of messages in a conversation.
