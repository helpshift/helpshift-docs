## Configure push notifications via Helpshift {#push-via-helpshift}

![urbanAirshipNotif.png](/static/books/android/urbanairshipnotif.png "urbanAirshipNotif.png")

Helpshift enables you to send notifications to your users. This is
particularly useful when you have multiple users on multiple platforms
like iOS and Android. Notifications are useful to tell your users when
you reply to an issue that they submitted. When the app is backgrounded,
the notification that is sent from Helpshift appears as a notification.

To know more about the FCM Push, refer:- [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/)

### Configure Helpshift Agent Dashboard {#configure-helpshift-push-admin}

To enable the Helpshift system to send push notifications to your users
you will have to add your FCM Key and Bundle Name via the helpshift
admin interface.

Enter your Google Push notifications credentials per app, via the
**Settings page > App listing in the left navigation > Scroll down to Push
Notifications** settings section for the app.

## Configure the Helpshift Unity SDK to handle notifications {#configure-helpshift-unity-sdk}

### Push notifications {#push-notifications}

#### Configure FCM push notification plugins {#}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

- When push is not configured, Helpshift SDK shows out-of-the-box "in-app notifications" for every message sent by Agents/Bots.
  You should call `HelpshiftSdk.getInstance().registerDeviceToken ()` API only after you have [configured the Helpshift dashboard](/unity/notifications-android#configure-helpshift-push-admin) for push notifications. Calling the `HelpshiftSdk.getInstance().registerDeviceToken ()` API without configuring the Helpshift dashboard will stop showing out-of-the-box "in-app notifications" for the end users.

</Admonition>

**Before you begin**

1. Integrate Helpshift Unity Android SDK as documented here: [Integration Guide](https://developers.helpshift.com/unity/getting-started-android/)
1. Integrate FCM Unity Android plugin as documented here: [Firebase Cloud Messaging Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/unity/client)

If you have already integrated push notifications, Use the **HelpshiftSdk.registerDeviceToken(string deviceToken)** API to register the device token with the Helpshift SDK. Helpshift can now start sending push notifications to your app.

Once this is done, you can use the **HelpshiftSdk.handlePushNotification(Dictionary<string, object\> pushNotificationData)** API to send the payload received in the notification.

To check whether this notification is being sent from the Helpshift's push notification service, please check the `origin` field of the notification. If it is `"helpshift`, the notification is a Helpshift notification.

```csharp
    public void OnTokenReceived(object sender, Firebase.Messaging.TokenReceivedEventArgs token) {
        HelpshiftSdk.getInstance().registerDeviceToken (token.Token);
    }

    public void OnMessageReceived(object sender, Firebase.Messaging.MessageReceivedEventArgs e) {
        IDictionary<string, string> pushData = e.Message.Data;

            if (pushData.ContainsKey ("origin") && pushData ["origin"].Equals ("helpshift")) {
                Dictionary<string, object> hsPushData = new Dictionary<string, object>();

                foreach (string key in pushData.Keys) {
                hsPushData.Add (key, pushData [key]);
            }
            HelpshiftSdk.getInstance().handlePushNotification (hsPushData);
        }
    }
```

If your application is not running and it receives a push notification then it will start the application in background (by invoking the push notification receiver registered in java). In this case, UnityEngine might not be initialized and the C# api `HelpshiftSdk.handlePushNotification` might not be useful.

If you are unable to delegate the push notification payload from the Java receiver class to C# api's then, for such cases, you can use the native Java api `HelpshiftUnity.handlePush(Context context, Intent intent)` to handle push notifications from Helpshift.

<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

There is a known issue with the Helpshift Unity SDK 4.0.0, in which a NullPointerException occurs; when the application is in the stopped state and a push notification is received and handled using the `HelpshiftUnity.handlePush(context, intent);` API. Please call `HelpshiftUnity.install(getApplication());` before calling `HelpshiftUnity.handlePush(context, intent);` to resolve this issue.

</Admonition>

In Java implementation of the receiver for push notifications, you can use this api as in the following example.

```java
public class HelpshiftCustomFCMService extends ListenerService {
    private static final String TAG = "Helpshift Native";

    @Override
    public void onMessageReceived(RemoteMessage message) {
        String from = message.getFrom();
        Map<String, String> data = message.getData();
        Log.d(TAG, "onMessageReceived, from: " + from + ", data: " + data);
        String origin = data.get("origin");
        if (origin != null && origin.equals("helpshift")) {
            Log.d(TAG, "Helpshift Notification received");
            // Handle push with native Helpshift java apis directly.
            HelpshiftUnity.handlePush(this, data);
        } else {
            Log.d(TAG, "Notification from non-helpshift service");
            // Call super to forward the notification to the default FCM service.
            super.onMessageReceived(message);
        }
    }
}
```

Refer the sample project for [FCM Unity plugin](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/unity/client) integration with Helpshift SDK [here](https://github.com/helpshift/helpshift-unity-examples/tree/master/Helpshift-Unity-5.x-Apps).

#### Configure Other push notification plugins {#other-plugins}

If you are using any third party plugin for push notifications. you can use **HelpshiftSdk.registerDeviceToken(string deviceToken)** API to register the device token and **HelpshiftSdk.handlePushNotification(Dictionary<string, object> pushNotificationData)** API to send the payload received in the notification.

The following is an example to register device token:

```csharp
void registrationSucceededEvent( string registrationId )
{
    Debug.Log( "registrationSucceededEvent: " + registrationId );
    HelpshiftSdk.getInstance().registerDeviceToken (registrationId);
}
```

Once this is done, you can use the **HelpshiftSdk.handlePushNotification(Dictionary<string, object\> pushNotificationData)** API to send payload which you receive in the **notificationReceivedEvent** callback in your plugin.

To check whether this notification is being sent from the Helpshift's push notification service, please check the `origin` field of the notification. If it is `"helpshift"`, the notification is a Helpshift notification.

### In-app notifications {#in-app-notifications}

In-app notifications are similar to notifications in the [notification drawer](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications.html) . Unlike push notifications, they appear only when you app is running.

These notifications are sent when an agent replies to a customer's issue. Your customers can go straight into the [conversation screen](/unity/support-tools-android#conversation-view) when they tap on the notification.

![](/static/books/android/i18n-in-app.png)

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

If the FCM device token is registered for push notifications, then in-app notifications will be disabled. In-app notifications are disabled to avoid duplicate notifications from both push notifications and in-app notifications.

</Admonition>

#### Configuring in-app notifications {#in-app}

If you do not want the in-app notifications support provided by the
Helpshift SDK, please set this flag to "no". The default value of this
flag is "yes" i.e in-app notifications will be enabled.<br />
Read more about in-app notifications in the [Notifications section.](/unity/notifications-android#in-app-notifications)

<div className="compact ">

|         |                         |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| Flag    | enableInAppNotification |
| Values  | "yes" / "no"            |
| Default | "yes"                   |

</div>

Example:

```csharp

    using Helpshift;
    .
    .
    .
    private HelpshiftSdk help;
    this.help = HelpshiftSdk.getInstance();
    Dictionary<string, string> configMap = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    configMap.Add("unityGameObject", "DemoControl");
    configMap.Add("enableInAppNotification", "yes");
    help.install("<YOUR_API_KEY>", "<YOUR_HELPSHIFT_DOMAIN>", "<YOUR_APP_ID>", configMap);

```

## Showing notification count when replies are sent to the user {#showing-notification-count}

### Via Helpshift API

If you want to show your user notifications for replies sent by the Agent to their Issues, you can use notification counts provided by the Helpshift SDK. These give you the total number of unread messages and display that number as a badge. You can get notification counts asynchronously by implementing the Helpshift delegate method [didReceiveUnreadMessageCount](/unity/delegates-android/).

The notification count is fetched on-demand from the SDK cache and Helpshift's servers. However, the count from the Helpshift's servers is rate limited and its value is returned only if a subsequent call to this API is made after the reset timeout or if the user just closed the chat screen (whichever is earlier). The reset timeout is 1 minute if there is an active issue else 5 minutes if there are no active issues.

Notifications are typically displayed as badges inside your app where a user clicks on the help section. These badges can be displayed anywhere in your app's interface to tell the user that they have unread replies/messages from you.

You can implement the "didReceiveUnreadMessageCount" delegate method like the following example:

```csharp
API:
using Helpshift;
.
.
.
private HelpshiftSdk help;
this.help = HelpshiftSdk.getInstance();
help.requestUnreadMessagesCount(true);

Delegate:
public void didReceiveUnreadMessagesCount(int count) {
    // your code here
}
```

### Via In-App Notifications

If you want to use the in-app notifications mechanism to get the count of unread notifications, you can implement the `didReceiveInAppNotificationCount` message handler on the Game object which you have registered at the time of install.

For example

```csharp

    public void didReceiveInAppNotificationCount(string count) {
        Debug.Log("In-app Notification count : " + count);
    }
```
