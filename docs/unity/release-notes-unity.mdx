# Release Notes



<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

With the transition to TLSv1.2 on Sep 20,2021, connections to a Helpshift SDK via any previous TLS version will not work as expected. Specifically, this means that:

* Helpshift SDKs will not work or load on lower-end Android devices (meaning, Android 4.x and earlier), because these lower-end Android versions do not support TLSv1.2.
* End-users on lower-end Android devices will not be able to access FAQs, raise new issues, or access their past support conversations.
* On a lower-end Android device, the mobile app that embeds a Helpshift SDK will be prevented from communicating with the SDK for any purpose. However, this disconnect will not cause any malfunction or crash on the parent application.


</Admonition>



<Admonition type="danger" title="Important">

* If you have released your App with `5.5.0` version, we highly recommend that you upgrade to `5.5.1` which fixes an important bug. Refer [here](/unity/release-notes-unity#v551).

5.5.0 Plugin Update

We found a Bug in plugin release 5.5.0 - Bot Options don't show up to end users when the Bot is triggered via New Issue Automation (NIA)

Note: The issue gets fixed when user closes and reopens the chat screen.

**Action needed:**

* If you are planning to integrate or are in the process of integrating SDK 5.5.0, we recommend integrating with 5.5.1 instead.
* If you have already released any of your apps with the affected SDKs and your New Issue Automation triggers options bot, we recommend that you upgrade to 5.5.1 SDK.

</Admonition>


** Release Notes: **

    * Apps built with Xcode 12 will crash when user taps on a notification sent from Helpshift dashboard for agent/bot replies.

       `Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSRangeException', reason: '*** -[__NSArrayM objectAtIndexedSubscript:]: index 0 beyond bounds for empty array'`

**Android**

* Updated to Android SDK `v7.9.0`  [View](/android/release-notes#v790)

	* App will crash when user starts a new conversation from a form-based experience.
	* Image orientation changes on some Android 11 devices when the user uploads an image.
	* If the issue filing flow is form-based then menu items are not clickable on the form when the app is in full screen mode. [View Impact](/android/troubleshooting#known-issues)
