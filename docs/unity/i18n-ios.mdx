# Going International {#going-international}

<Intro>

Localizing & Internationalizing your in-app Support.

</Intro>

## Internationalization {#i18n}

Helpshift iOS SDK comes with support for **45** languages out of the box with English as the default. A bundle file named `HsLocalization.bundle` is included in the framework that consists of default localizations. If you need to include additional localized strings, add a bundle named `HelpshiftCustomLocalization.bundle` to the Copy Bundle Resources Phase with the localized strings from `HelpshiftCustomLocalizations` folder included in the package.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

On Unity 5.4, the default localization bundle `HsLocalization.bundle` does not get added to the Xcode project automatically. To include this to the Xcode project, change its platform to iOS in Unity platform inspector.

</Admonition>

The Helpshift SDK will be localized based on the user’s device language. This can be set by going to General → Language & Region → iPhone Language. If the user’s device language is not available, English will be used as default.

#### Add only required languages from HSLocalization

If you are adding strings for a certain language, it enables that language in your app when submitted to the App store.
This has app wide implications and may cause unwanted problems if not taken care of.
Specifically, this can lead the App Store to detect that you support a particular language even
though you have not specifically added that language to your application.
Make sure to only add those languages that your app supports.

The Helpshift SDK will be localized based on the user’s device language. This can be set by going to General → Language & Region → iPhone Language. If the user’s device language is not available, English will be used as default.

If the end-user has a language already set for their device (via
Settings->General->International->Language) the correct language
translations will be used. If the said language is not available English
will be used as default.

## Set SDK language {#set-language}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

For v4.11.0 and above

</Admonition>

You can set the SDK language using this API.
By default, the device's prefered language is used by the SDK.

For Example :

```csharp

	// Language Code is like "en" for English or "fr" for French
	HelpshiftSdk.getInstance().setSDKLanguage("fr");
```
