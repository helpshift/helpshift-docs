## Framework packaging for SDK

With version 5.4.0, Helpshift SDK is packaged as a dynamic framework rather than a static library. Please follow the steps mentioned here if you are migrating from an older version of Helpshift SDK.

### Integration changes

1. Delete the old Helpshift files from your Assets directory and then import the new unitypackage.
2. If you have customized Helpshift theming plist files, make a copy of them before deleting the old files.
3. Once you have imported the new package, copy the files to `Assets/Plugings/Helpshift/iOS/HelpshiftCustomThemes`, replacing any existing files with same names.
4. Uncomment the line `HelpshiftPostProcess.AddHelpshiftCustomThemes(project);` in `HelpshiftPostProcess.cs` to ensure the theming files are copied in the final Xcode project.

### Code changes

If you are using Helpshift headers in the generated Xcode project, replace their usages with the following -

- Replace `#import "HelpshiftCore.h”` with `#import <Helpshift/HelpshiftCore.h>`
- Replace `#import ”HelpshiftSupport.h”` with `#import <Helpshift/HelpshiftSupport.h>`

If you are app is using [Helpshift delegates](/unity/delegates-ios/), call the `HelpshiftSdk.registerDelegates()` API to continue listening to the delegates. Call this method as early in the lifecycle of your game as possible. We recommend calling it in the `Start()` method of your game's first `GameObject`. You might already have this method call in your `GameObject` if you are using our Android plugin as well. In that case, simply remove the `#if UNITY_ANDROID` and `#endif` surrounding this call.
