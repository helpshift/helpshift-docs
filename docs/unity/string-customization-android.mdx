<Intro>

Customize all the strings in Helpshift SDK's user interface


</Intro>

**Before you begin**

1. Integrate Helpshift Unity Android SDK as documented here: [Integration Guide](https://developers.helpshift.com/unity/getting-started-android/)
1. Though optional, we recommend you to download and set up the Android Studio. [Android Studio Setup Guide](https://developer.android.com/studio)

The Helpshift Unity SDK zip folder includes the **HelpshiftUnityAndroidResources**, an open source android studio project, to customize theme and string resources according to your application.

The Helpshift Unity SDK includes a default build of **HelpshiftUnityAndroidResources** project i.e **helpshift-plugin-resources.aar**. The default aar contains the string resources for all the supported languages.

You can customize almost all the strings in the Helpshift SDK with additional internationalization options. For string customization please follow steps below :

1. Open the Android Studio and import the **HelpshiftUnityAndroidResources** project
    1. If Android Studio is launched for the first time, select **Open an existing Android Studio project** and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Helpshift Unity SDK and select *HelpshiftUnityAndroidResources* directory.
    1. If Android Studio already has an open project, select from the menu **File** > **New** > **Import Project** and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Helpshift Unity SDK and select *HelpshiftUnityAndroidResources* directory.
1. Find the resource-id of the string that you want to change. See [String resources](https://developers.helpshift.com/unity/string-customization-android#string-resources) in SDK for the full list of strings.
1. Navigate and open the `HelpshiftUnityAndroidResources/helpshift-plugin/src/main/res/values-<language-code>/values.xml` file and modify the selected string resource value in step-2
1. Open the terminal window and run the following command: **./gradlew clean build**
    1. Once build is executed successfully, the `helpshift-plugin-resources.aar` file is generated in *HelpshiftUnityAndroidResources* directory.
    1. Output path: **[helpshift-sdk-download-path]/HelpshiftUnityAndroidResources/helpshift-plugin-resources.aar**
1. Copy the `helpshift-plugin-resources.aar` file and replace it with **[Unity project]/Assets/Plugins/Android/helpshift-plugin-resources.aar** file.
    1. Build and run the Unity project to verify your string changes.


Read [Going International](/unity/i18n-android/) if you want to change the strings for a particular
language or want to add a language translation of your own.
