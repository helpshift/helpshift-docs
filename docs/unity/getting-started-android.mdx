<Intro>

You're 5 steps away from adding great in-app support to your Unity game.

</Intro>

Guide to integrating the Unity plugin for the Helpshift SDK which you can call from your C# and Javascript game scripts.

## Requirements {#version-requirements}

- Unity 5.5.6 and above.
- Supported Android OS version: 14 and above

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

If you have a project with Unity version prior to 5.3, you could use the build mentioned [here](https://support.helpshift.com/kb/article/can-i-install-an-older-version-of-the-helpshift-sdk#unity).

  classes="mb-4"
/>

Helpshift SDK _.zip_ folder includes:

<div className="text-sm compact ">

|                                               |                                                                                     |

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

We recommend you to upgrade to the latest SDK as mentioned above. However, if you are currently using Unity SDK 4.x and need more details, click [here](https://old-developers.helpshift.com/unity-4x/getting-started-android/).

</Admonition>

## Add Helpshift to your Unity project {#adding-to-project}

- Unzip the Helpshift Unity SDK package.
- Helpshift Unity SDK appears as a standard `.unitypackage` which you can import through the Unity package import procedure.
- Following are the steps to import the `helpshift-plugin-unity-version.unitypackage` into your Unity game:
  1. If you have integrated Helpshift SDK previously, delete the existing `Assets/Helpshift` folder from your unity project.
  2. In the Open Unity project, navigate to **Assets** drop-down menu and select the **Import Package** > **Custom Package**
  3. From the unzipped SDK, select `helpshift-plugin-unity-version.unitypackage` file to import the Helpshift SDK.
  4. In the _Import Unity Package window_, click **Import**

## Resolve Android Support library requirements {#resolve-android-support-library-requirements}

Helpshift SDK depends on android support libraries. You can get these libraries in one of the following ways depending on the build process that you use.

### Resolve dependency when using Unity's Internal or Unity's internal Gradle build system {#resolve-dependency-via-jar-resolver}

Use **Unity Jar Resolver** plugin to download and integrate android library dependencies.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

If your project already uses the _Unity Jar Resolver_, you can skip the _Unity Jar Resolver_ importing step.

</Admonition>

- Import the **Unity Jar Resolver** plugin into your Unity project
  1. In the Open Unity project, navigate to **Assets** drop-down menu and select the **Import Package** > **Custom Package**
  2. From the unzipped Helpshift SDK, select `unity-jar-resolver/external-dependency-manager-1.2.160.unitypackage` file to import the Unity Jar resolver.
  3. In the _Import Unity Package_ window, click **Import**

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

If you are not able to import _Unity Jar Resolver_ packaged with Helpshift plugin due to any reason, you can use any version of _Unity Jar Resolver_ as per your needs.
Refer here: [Unity Jar Resolver](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver/releases)

</Admonition>

- If the Unity Jar resolver wants to enable Android Auto-resolution, click the _Enable_ button, to resolve all the dependencies automatically on changing any dependency file. You can enable or disable the settings using _Assets_ > _Play Services Resolver_ > _Android Resolver_ > _Settings_
- By default, the Unity jar resolver auto-resolves all the required dependencies. Following are the steps to resolve dependencies manually:
  1. In the Open Unity project, navigate to **Assets** dropdown menu and choose **Play services resolver** > **Android Resolve**
  2. Select the **Resolve** or **Force Resolve**
- To know more about the Unity Jar Resolver, refer to: [Unity Jar Resolver](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver)

### Resolve dependency when using custom Gradle template or Export Project {#resolve-dependency-via-gradle}

*Unity's in-built gradle build support* and *exporting to android studio* does not support per plugin gradle script. Therefore, by default, Helpshift SDK cannot add the dependencies by itself.

The `mainTemplate.gradle` is genereted when you enable the **Custom Gradle Template** property on the Player window.

The `build.gradle` exists in generated Gradle project when you enable the **Export Project** property on the Player window and Build the project.

Update **dependencies** section of the `mainTemplate.gradle` or `build.gradle` file as:

```
    dependencies {
        compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
        compile(name: 'Helpshift', ext:'aar')
        compile(name: 'helpshift-plugin-resources', ext:'aar')
        implementation(':helpshift-plugin-wrapper')
        compile 'com.android.support:design:26.0.2'
        compile 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:26.0.2'
        compile 'com.android.support:cardview-v7:26.0.2'
    }
```

## Add package name to AndroidManifest.xml {#adding-package-name}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

If you are using Unity 2020 or higher version, please update the name of `helpshift-plugin-wrapper` directory located at `/Assets/Plugins/Android/helpshift-plugin-wrapper` to `helpshift-plugin-wrapper.androidlib`

Please refer [troubleshooting](/unity/troubleshooting-android#unity2020-android-lib-issue) for more information.

</Admonition>

If you are using gradle build system then ${applicationId} is automatically replaced during build time.

Otherwise, open `AndroidManifest.xml` located at `<project_dir>/Assets/Plugins/Android/helpshift-plugin-wrapper/` and look for `${applicationId}` located in `<provider>` tag. Replace it with the package name of your android app.

As an example, if your package name is `com.Company.ProductName`, `<provider>` tag will now look like this:

```
        <provider
            android:name="com.helpshift.support.providers.HelpshiftFileProvider"
            android:authorities="com.Company.ProductName.helpshift.fileprovider"
            android:exported="false"
            android:grantUriPermissions="true" >
            <meta-data
                android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
                android:resource="@xml/hs__provider_paths" />
        </provider>
```

## Initializing Helpshift in your app {#initializing}

To use Helpshift's APIs, please import the Helpshift's namespace like below

```csharp

    using Helpshift;

```

Helpshift SDK uniquely identifies your App with the combination of:

<div className="text-sm compact ">

|             |                                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Key     | Your unique developer API Key.                              |
| Domain Name | Your Helpshift domain name. For example : foo.helpshift.com |
| App ID      | A unique ID assigned to your app.                           |

</div>

To get the `API Key`, `Domain Name` and the `App ID`, navigate to `Settings`>`SDK (for Developers)` in your agent dashboard and scroll down to **"Initializing Helpshift"** section. <Image src="/static/books/common/settings-integration.png"  width="full" />

Select your App from the dropdown and copy the three tokens to be passed when initializing Helpshift.

Initialize Helpshift by calling the method _install(apiKey, domain, appId)_ API

```csharp

    using Helpshift;
    .
    .
    .
    public class MyGameControl : MonoBehaviour
    {
        private HelpshiftSdk help;
        ...

        void Awake() {
            help = HelpshiftSdk.getInstance();
            var configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>();
            help.install("<API_KEY>", "<DOMAIN_NAME>", "<APP_ID>", configMap);
        }
        ...
    }


```

## Start using Helpshift {#start-using}

Helpshift is now integrated in your app. You should now use the support APIs to [present FAQ](/unity/support-tools-android#faqs-view) or [conversation screens](/unity/support-tools-android#conversation-view) inside your app.

Run your app, and try starting a test conversation using the _ShowConversation_ API call.
Then goto your Helpshift agent dashboard and reply to experience the in-app messaging.

Sample usage for FAQs and conversation APIs:

```csharp

    public class MyGameControl : MonoBehaviour
    {
        private HelpshiftSdk help;

        void OnGUI () {
            ...
            var configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>();
            // Presenting FAQs to your customers
            if (MenuButton (helpButton))
            {
                help.showFAQs(configMap);
            }

            // Starting a conversation with your customers
            if (MenuButton (contactButton))
            {
                help.ShowConversation(configMap);
            }
        }
    }

```

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Since the Helpshift plugin is meant for mobile devices only, you should put all Helpshift calls inside checks to make sure they are only called when running on a device.
