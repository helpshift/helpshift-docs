### Secondary Dex specifications

For tackling the method count limit of 65536 on android, we have introduced Helpshift SDK dex file.
Helpshift SDK loads its own dex file in a background thread without affecting the application performance.

The dex will be loaded on the first call to HelpshiftSdk.getInstance() in the application's lifecycle.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Applies to v2.3.1 to v4.1.0.

From v5.0.0, secondary dex loading is not used by Helpshift plugin.

</Admonition>

### Unified dex specifications {#unified-dex-specs}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Applies to v2.3.1 to v4.1.0.

From v5.0.0, secondary dex loading is not used by Helpshift plugin.

</Admonition>

Dex loading generally takes around 8-9 seconds on the very first load. (i.e the first time HelpshiftSdk.getInstance() is called after app install)
For subsequent loads (i.e on first HelpshiftSdk.getInstance() call on app restarts) it is cached and would take around 100-150ms.

If your app is already using multidex setup, Helpshift SDK will not affect it since it is independent of the
other dex files.

#### Integration impact :

1. Since unified dex package already includes android support libraries, it is assumed that no other plugin uses the android support libraries.
1. Remove the previous Helpshift package from your Unity project as it may duplicate code between dex and android support libraries. After importing the new unity package make sure there are no jar files in the following locations :
   1. _/Assets/Plugins/Android/appcompat/libs_
   1. _/Assets/Plugins/Android/cardview/libs_
   1. _/Assets/Plugins/Android/recyclerview/libs_
   1. _/Assets/Plugins/Android/design/libs_
1. After importing the unity package make sure that the following jar file exists :
   1. _/Assets/Plugins/Android/helpshift/libs/helpshiftloader.jar_
   1. _/Assets/Plugins/Android/helpshift/helpshiftnotificationhandler.jar_
1. After importing the unity package, make sure that the dex file exists at
   _/Assets/Plugins/Android/assets/helpshift/helpshift_classes.dex_
1. No modifications to existing API signatures.

### Helpshift SDK-only dex specifications {#hs-only-dex-specs}

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Applies to v2.3.1 to v4.1.0.

From v5.0.0, secondary dex loading is not used by Helpshift plugin.

</Admonition>

Dex loading generally takes around 2-3 seconds on the very first load. (i.e the first time HelpshiftSdk.getInstance() is called after app install)

   1. _/Assets/Plugins/Android/helpshift/libs/helpshiftloader.jar_
   1. _/Assets/Plugins/Android/helpshift/helpshiftnotificationhandler.jar_
1. After importing the unity package, make sure that the dex file exists at
   _/Assets/Plugins/Android/assets/helpshift/helpshift_classes.dex_
1. If android support libraries are used by any other plugin then you can deselect the required libraires when importing the unity package.
1. No modifications to existing API signatures.

## v2.5.0 {#integration-impact-250}

### Integration impact

If you are upgrading from older versions of the Helpshift Unity package then please remove the following folders from `<project path>/Assets/Plugins/Android`

1. appcompat
1. design
1. cardview
1. recyclerview

This version is packaged with required android support libs v23.4.0 and is also tested with Android Nougat devices.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

If the developer wants to integrate with android support libs 24.x, there are reported issues on pre-lolipop devices
Refer [this blog](https://medium.com/@chrisbanes/appcompat-v23-2-age-of-the-vectors-91cbafa87c88#.zm0nvq4xu) and the [issue here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35622438/update-android-support-library-to-23-2-0-cause-error-xmlpullparserexception-bin).

Unity does not support android build for the vector changes introduced in 24.x version. Refer [here](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/1252014/unity-android-build-support-for-support-v7-v24xx.html)

Helpshift Unity plugin is tested with 24.x support lib version but does not work on pre-lollipop devices because of the Unity android build incompatibility.
