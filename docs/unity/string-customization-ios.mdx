Customize all the strings in Helpshift SDK's user interface


</Intro>

Starting from version 2.4.0, Helpshift now uses the HSLocalization bundle to read the default values of all the string translations.

You can customize all the strings used in the Helpshift SDK by following the steps below:

1. Create a new simple folder `HelpshiftCustomLocalization` in your project from Finder.
1. Go to `HelpshiftCustomLocalizations` folder and copy the lproj files for all the languages you want to support. You can find this folder at `Assets/Helpshift/Plugins/iOS/HelpshiftCustomLocalizations`.
1. Add the lproj files selected in the previous step to the HelpshiftCustomLocalization folder.
1. In `HelpshiftCustomLocalization` folder, change translations of the relevant keys in the HelpshiftLocalizable.strings files.
1. Rename `HelpshiftCustomLocalization` folder to the `HelpshiftCustomLocalization.bundle`. Your system will ask you confirmation to add "bundle" extension to the Folder and just click on "Add". 
1. Add this bundle to your project from Xcode using File -> Add Files to `<Project Name>` -> Select the `HelpshiftCustomLocalization.bundle`
1. Go to `Build Phases` settings tab of your project and Expand Bundle Resources menu
1. Drag the `HelpshiftCustomLocalization.bundle` from your project navigator to `Copy Bundle Resources` menu. Alternatively you can also add this bundle using + icon in the `Copy Bundle Resources` menu. SDK will start using your customized strings now.

Below is the description of the keys (in the `HelpshiftLocalizable.strings` file) for each of the customizable strings in the app:

The messages from the Identity Bot and the QuickSearch Bot will be sent by the Helpshift servers, so they won't be customizable in the SDK.
