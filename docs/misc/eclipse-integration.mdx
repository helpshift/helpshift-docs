# Integrating Helpshift SDK for Android with your Eclipse Project {#integrate-eclipse}


## Adding the latest stable release of the SDK to your project {#add-to-project}

Helpshift Android SDK uses Android's Support Libraries for Material
Design support. To add the Helpshift SDK to your **Android Application Project**, you
will need to add following Andorid Support Libraries :

1. [Design Library](http://android-developers.blogspot.in/2015/05/android-design-support-library.html)
1. [v7 recyclerview library](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/features.html#v7-recyclerview)
1. [v7 cardview library](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/features.html#v7-cardview)

All these libraries are located in your Android SDK location
_[Android/sdk/extras/android/support]_. We recommend you to add these dependencies first before you add Helpshift SDK.

1. Import **appcompat, cardview and recyclerview** library located at
   _[Android/sdk/extras/android/support/v7]_. Go to **Project
   Properties** and make sure that all of them are marked as **Is Library**

1. Import design library located at _[Android/sdk/extras/android/support]_.
 Go to **Project Properties** of design library and add above 3 libraries
as its dependency.

1. Select _Android > Existing Android Code Into Workspace_, and click _Next_.
1. Click _Browse_ for **Root Directory** and Select path to
   `helpshift-android-sdk` > _Finish_.

## Enable the flag for manifest merge {#enable-manifest}

Set the flag for `manifestmerger.enabled` to `true` in your `project.properties`:


```text

    manifestmerger.enabled=true


```

## Add reference of the Helpshift SDK {#add-reference}

To add reference to Helpshift SDK in your project:

1. In the Package Explorer, right-click your project and select _Properties_.
1. In the Properties window, select the **"Android"** properties group at left and locate the Library properties at right.
1. Click _Add_ to open the Project Selection dialog. From the list of available library projects, select Helpshift SDK and click _OK_.

## Copy the Helpshift assets to appropriate paths {#helpshift-assets}

The Ant build system does not include a way to package a library's assets folder along with the Application APK.
Since the Helpshift SDK ships with an assets folder, you will need to follow the steps given below to complete the integration process.

1. Copy **hs__data** from Helpshift/assets folder.

1. Paste **hs__data** to your application's assets folder and delete the **hs__data** file from Helpshift's assets folder.
