# Deep Linking in FAQs {#ios-deep-links}

<Intro>

Using custom URL schemes to support deep linking in your app

</Intro>

Use custom URL schemes to direct users to particular sections of your app from Helpshift FAQs. You can use these schemes to provide a more seamless experience for the user. For example, if your iOS app has a registration screen, clicking on a registration link in an FAQ can directly take the user to that screen.

## Insert custom URL schemes in FAQs {#custom-url-in-faqs}

When editing your FAQ, select the text and then click on create a link.

<Image
  src="/static/books/misc/add-ios-deep-link-1.png"
  width="half"
  alt="add-ios-deep-link-1.png"
/>

In the dialog that pops up, enter your custom URL and save the FAQ.

<Image
  src="/static/books/misc/add-ios-deep-link-2.png"
  width="half"
  alt="add-ios-deep-link-2.png"
/>

## Handle deep links in your iOS App {#handle-deep-link}

To handle the custom URLs in your iOS app, make sure first that your app's Info.list supports the custom URL scheme that you've provided in the FAQs. [[1]](http://iosdevelopertips.com/cocoa/launching-your-own-application-via-a-custom-url-scheme.html)

You will then need to implement,`application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation:` in your app delegate, to handle and take the required action. For example:
```
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {

    // URL is myapp://discount-scheme/id304
    if ([url.scheme isEqualToString:@"myapp"]) {
        if ([url.relativePath isEqualToString:@"/id304"]) {
            // Handle deep link in app. Do something inside your app.
            [MyApp doSomething];
        }
    }

    return YES;
}
```
