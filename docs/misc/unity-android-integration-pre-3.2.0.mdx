The Helpshift SDK plugin contains the following files

<div className="text-sm compact ">

|                           |                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sdk/Helpshift.jar         | The SDK jar file                                                                             |
| sdk/res/                  | Folder containing the layouts, strings, resources, themes and images required by the library |
| sdk/AndroidManifest.xml   | The manifest file for the Helpshift plugin                                                   |
| sdk/Helpshift-android.dll | A dll which exposes the Helpshift API to the Unity C# scripts.                               |
| repackage_unity_plugin.sh | A shell script which combines the v7/appcompat and its resources with the Helpshift plugin   |
| HSBuild/                  | Build tools folder which will create apk from your Unity project                             |

</div>

## **Step 2:** Add Helpshift to your Unity project

1. Navigate to the **helpshift-unity-sdk-android-x.x.x/** folder on your terminal and run the repackaging script:

```text

        sh repackage_unity_plugin.sh <path-to-v7/appcompat-directory>


```

1. Drag and drop the contents of the **helpshift-unity-sdk-android-x.x.x/sdk/** folder to the `Assets/Plugins/Android` folder of your Unity project.

## **Step 3:** Build Integration

### If you're not already exporting an Android project out of your Unity game, follow this step. / .unspaced-header /

The way Unity builds an Android apk, it purges files required by Helpshift multilingual on-device search. This leads to **runtime crashes**. To avoid this you should create the game's apk using the build tools provided by the Helpshift plugin:

**For Pro users** (via Unity BuildPipeline)

1. Copy the **HSBuild/** folder into the **Assets/External/** folder in your Unity project.
1. Open the **HSBuild/Editor/Build.cs** file and add the list of scenes which you want to build in the scenes array.
1. Open the **HSBuild/Editor/AppInfo.cs** file and update the relevant fields such as andriodHome, getAppPath, longName etc.
1. In the Unity IDE, you will now see a Build/Android menu option in the Tools menu.

   <Image
     src="/static/books/unity/unity-android-build-menu.png"
     width="major"
     alt="title"
   />{" "}

1. Click on it and wait for the build to complete.
1. Your android project will be created in the **build/** directory of the Unity project.
1. The name of the debug apk will be &lt;longName&gt;-debug.apk and it will be installed directly to your test device connected via adb.

**For Free users**

1. From the **Build and Run** menu, please select the 'Google Android Project' option and click **Export**.
1. This will create the android project in the path that you select.
1. Run the **build.sh** script provided in the **HSBuild/Editor/** folder as follows:

```text

        $ sh build.sh <android-project-path> <project-name> <android-sdk-path>


    * **android-project-path**: path of the created android project
    * **project-name**: project name (This will be the name of the debug APK which will be created)
    * **android-sdk-path**: path of the android SDK
```
